      <h2>Thank you so much for signing up.</h2>
      <p>I'm about to send you the first email to get you started. You'll probably hear from me a few times this week, but I want you to know that the newsletter comes out to your email every Thursday so during this week you should get a few emails. </p>
      <h4>Make sure that you <strong>check your promotions tab if you're a GMail user</strong> or your spam folder if it ended up there.</h4>
      <p>We're working behind the scenes to add a few things of value for the newsletter subscribers. You're on the newsletter list, so you're going to get resources each week about becoming a more professional designer.</p>

      <h3>If you want to do something while you wait for the next edition...</h3> <p>I designed a <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assessment"><strong>design skills self assessment</strong></a> that you can take. This will give you an idea of what skills you are feeling comfortable with, or which skills you might still need to master. Maybe you haven't had any practice with these at all. This will be the first thing to get massively updated soon. So try now, and I'll let you know when v2.0 is finished :P</p>
