      <p>Pretty soon you should receive the link to join the community.</p>
      <p>If you want to do something while you wait, I designed a <strong>design skills self assessment</strong> that you can take. This will give you an idea of what skills you are feeling comfortable with, or which skills you might still need to master. Maybe you haven't had any practice with these at all. This will give you a learning path and some resources to start learning while you wait.</p>
