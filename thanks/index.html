      <p><strong>I'm about to send you the first email</strong> to get you started. You'll probably hear from me a few times this week, but I want you to know that the newsletter comes out to your email every Thursday. It is only during this week you should get a few emails.</p>
      <h4>Make sure that you <strong>check your promotions tab if you're a GMail user</strong> or your spam folder if it ended up there.</h4>
      <p>We're working behind the scenes to add a few things of value for the newsletter subscribers. You're on the newsletter list, so you're going to get design tips and resources each week about becoming a more professional designer.</p>
      <h4>First, some resources...</h4>
