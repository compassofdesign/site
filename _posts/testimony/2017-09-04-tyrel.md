Being a part of Compass of Design has really inspired me to get more into designing. Being primarily a developer, the content I see within this community push me farther and urge me to be a better designer.

Not only is Darian incredibly active among the community members, giving advice, reviews, helpful resources, he is in general, an incredible guy. Being a member of this community has definitely been a fantastic choice.
