For me Compass of Design was a no-brainer to join in. I knew Darian the founder from another project and I was really into the idea of a community of designers to exchange ideas, get feedback and talk about god and the world.

Compass of Design is that for me, a place of good people, many of them I would consider friends by now, who exchanges, talks and motivates another. Or just to share a silly video now and then.

I had the opportunity to write my first article on Medium under the Compass of Design brand. Something I never even dreamt about something like that. Thank you Darian & the whole group.
