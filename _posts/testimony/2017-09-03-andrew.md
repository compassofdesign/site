Being apart of a community, such as Compass of Design, is really fullfilling for myself. The ability to give and recieve honest feedback from and to other new, seasoned, or simply intersted designers is a beneficial element for building more skills in the field.

Darian provides a construcive, yet energizing and fun environment through his Slack channel, and delivers professional, original ideas through his newsletter.

I believe that anyone who joins this stellar community will build connections, skillsets, and lifelong friendships with other like-minded designers, developers, and hobbiests, as well as building a personal connection with the Founder of Compass of Design, Darian.
