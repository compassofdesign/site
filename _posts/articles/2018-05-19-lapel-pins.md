# The compass guide to designing your own custom lapel pins:

### Lapel Pins

A few months back, we had a chance to look at the ways that you can design and
order your own custom vinyl stickers. Now, though I’m not a print designer by
trade, a lot of you messaged me back saying that it was “Super helpful” for
them.

With my history as a web designer, we don’t always consider what it would be
like having to work with physical products. And because my focus this year is
only taking on branding and logo design clients, I want to make sure that if you
ask me, I can give some pretty good recommendations still on how to work for
print.

*This also will help tremendously when clients ask for a branding engagement
that involves a lot of print work.*

As I start to build up that knowledge, I’m going to be sharing what I’ve found
and what I’ve learned as a result of working with three different printing
methods, designing for physical goods.

**I put myself through the process of working with:**

* [Made by Cooper](https://www.madebycooper.com/)** **— for 2 custom hard enamel
lapel pins
* [Sticker Mule](https://www.stickermule.com/)** **— for custom cut stickers (Die
Cut and Kiss Cut)
* [Rise and Shine Letterpress](http://www.riseandshinepaper.com/)** **— for custom
designed pin backing cards

If you also think it would be super valuable, I can also share what I’m learning
about how to ship these to people, like I’m doing for our community members that
shared their address with me. (:

### I loved watching those “how it’s made” videos from the discovery channel

This video below is a “how it’s made” about the Lapel Pin making process. This
may vary from company to company, but this is all close to the same for most
companies that do it. Actually, this may or may not be how it’s done today. It’s
how it used to be done if not. haha.

The fun part of making lapel pins is that the process is very limited, and in
order to get a design that works, and that you are satisfied, you have to know
the medium really well, or be willing to make compromises.

For those who don’t watch it, [there are essentially a few
steps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lapel_pin#Modern_manufacturing_process):

* They make a negative die and mold
* Fill it with hot metal
* Plate it with the type of metal you chose
* Polishing the rough edges
* Coloring in the designs
* Setting the Enamel

The specific type and process you choose can have an effect on how much the
designs cost to produce.

While you play with most pin producers cost calculators, you notice that you get
a good discount for buying more pins in bulk as opposed to smaller orders.

**A lot of what you pay for is setup**: The mold and the die

The materials to produce are run later in the process and essentially aren’t as
expensive.

**The other modifiers to cost are:**

* More complicated designs are usually more expensive to produce
* The enameling process you choose [(Hard vs Soft
Enamel)](https://www.madebycooper.com/blog/soft-enamel-vs-hard-enamel-pins)
* How many colors you choose to use (less colors is less expensive)
* If you use any special colors (glow in the dark, glittery, etc)
* any add-ons like custom printed cards and pin clasps.

I made a run of 100 lapel pins of two designs, and both were about $2.65–3.30
per pin to produce. (I only say it that way because some of you probably don’t
want every option available and some do).

**The companies that make them:**<br> The companies are spread out all over the
place, and there’s a huge amount that are produced through China and Korea,
like, a lot. So you should always try to do research with who you want to make
them.

There’s a really good list of pin companies here from [Designer
News](https://www.designernews.co/stories/73113-ask-dn-where-do-all-the-cool-enamel-pins-get-made)<br>
There is also:

* [Made by Cooper ](http://madebycooper.com/)(Who I chose)
* [pinmart.com](http://www.pinmart.com/)
* [Baseball Trading Pins](https://www.baseballtradingpins.net/)
* [Curio Mill](http://www.curiomill.com/) to crowd fund your pins
* [The Studio](https://www.thestudio.com/)

### So how do you come up with the pin designs?

### Sketch out your ideas before going to digital.

Per our last guide on tinkering, we talked about sketching your designs before
jumping on the digital bandwagon.

I really love sketching out my ideas first before jumping on the computer to
pound out a design with the mouse and keyboard.

When you create your designs, you have to remember that the simpler designs will
be the most true to their original sketches once printed out.

What you see at the top of the email is **almost **how they turned out.

My process above was just to get as many ideas of where to start, and then I had
a really cool idea, which I expanded on the right.

### Use the right settings

When taking your sketch to digital, there are a few things you need to
understand about this process.

Human beings are incapable of objectively telling how big something is without
something relative to compare it to. We’re comparison beings. So when designing
these pins, we have to work with either [Inches (like 0.65") or in Millimeters
(like 19mm).](http://www.jpscorner.com/images/Ring_Diameter_Gauge_1.pdf)

Since we are also working with die struck materials, the thickness of your lines
and the gaps between them have minimum requirements. I admit that my design
above was slightly ambitious but it was worth pursuing. I did my best to size
everything to their requirements.

Some of those requirements are here below.

1.  **We are desgining physical objects.**<br> These objects are going to have
actual dimensions, so instead of working in pixels, you will want to select the
right unit (Inches or Millimeters) depending on where you’re getting these made.
1.  If you’re curious about what the common settings are, check with the printer or
search online.
1.  **You must eliminate things like Overlay/Blend Modes and gradients**
1.  These type of effects aren’t really possible to achieve consistently for mass
production unless your printing company says that it’s possible. You might be
able to get clever how you represent that with your pin, but expectations are
that the simpler the better.
1.  **Your color profile should be in Pantone or CMYK**<br> Usually, your printer
can work on this with you with your proof, but knowing right off the bat which
pantone color or CMYK setting you want your color to be will help you save time
and get quicker to production.
1.  If you’re wondering what color profile you’re already in, you might be able to
see at the top of your document like in Adobe Illustrator. It has the file name
and then the profile of color being used.
1.  For those who have no idea what a pantone color is [you can check out this
converter here ](https://codebeautify.org/hex-to-pantone-converter)(for RGB,
HSL, etc) [or this guide to
pantone.](https://creativemarket.com/blog/pantone-dictionary)
1.  **Be as specific as possible**<br> Sometimes it’s hard to know from an image
exactly how something should be done. But if you know what you need done, like a
specific part that needs a hole or gap, or where your pin needs to be placed on
the back, what specific colors to use, what’s getting colored and what’s not.
1.  The more specific you are on the process the better.

I know I had said it once, but you need to make sure your idea is simple enough
to be put through their process and turn out correctly.

They did say that the lines in the center were too complicated for the process,
which I expected so we compromised first, and then opted to simplify later.

If you’re using more than 4 colors usually, the price goes up. So it’s in your
best interest to come up with designs that distill your idea into it’s simplest
form.

### Double check everything.

Don’t send your file off or approve your design proofs without checking these
things

* That the right color profile was used (Pantone)
* That your design has all the right pieces labeled with the features you wanted
* That you have all text and complex line work outlined as shapes, not lines
* That you created the document at the right size and with the right units
* That you’re not doing something crazy that the lapel pin companies can’t make
* That all of the elements are where they should be on the pins
* That any proof you have matches what you have outlined.

And on top of checking all of that, sometimes the printing company will send
their own proof before going to production. Always double check those with the
original design. Make sure that you check off the list again there too.

The people that prepare everything are human, and though they are professionals
in their field, they make mistakes too sometimes. It’s okay.

You will usually have some time in between to check your proof before it’s sent
to production.

I had a misfortunate mark, where these three proofs below came back different
than I had imagined.

I didn’t want glow in the dark for this pin, and then, I asked that was removed,
I got sent a design where they removed glow in the dark, but switched the metal
and color that the design would be. (kind of a cool idea, but not what I had
wanted), finally, the last proof was good.

### How did they turn out?

They turned out really really good.<br> I would recommend trying this at least
once if you’ve been curious and have a really cool design that everyone seems to
like.

I plan to share mine with the members of the community (and future members until
I run out) and doing more of these to give them in the future. (:
