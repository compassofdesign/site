# Typeform & Squarespace

## Do they work Together?

[Typeform](https://medium.com/@typeform) is such a great innovation. I won’t get
into form-building here as articulation and explaining how is kinda their bag,
so check out their Help Center
[here](https://www.typeform.com/help/my-1st-typeform/). Now, if you happen to be
working with [Squarespace Inc.](https://medium.com/@squarespace), you may be a
bit confused on the integration as I was.

The initial steps were easy enough.

I created a beautiful form in Typeform, designed it just the way I wanted and
went to the “Share” tab.

Then I clicked “Embed” and copied my embed code.

Going back into Squarespace, I navigated to the appropriate page and opened the
Embed block. It’s an easy paste into the text field and a refresh to see the
polished form on your website.

And that’s it!

A perfect form!

The end!

But not really. There was one considerable problem.

### Friction came at this point.

others too.

Regardless of the browser, the form wouldn’t load 25–50% of the time. So my
[Need a Brand](http://www.jbonedesign.com/needabrand) page was a blank page with
no call to action. For a good three weeks, potential clients were navigating to
a really important page only to be met with nothing.

While embed codes may seem fickle, they rely on a full URL to properly display.
Check how you set up your navigation links. If you linked them to a content
link, this may be the problem. A [content
link](https://support.squarespace.com/hc/en-us/articles/206232858#toc-content-tab---link-to-your-site-s-content)
points to an internal page or collection items filtered by tag or category.

links](https://support.squarespace.com/hc/en-us/articles/206232858#toc-content-tab---link-to-your-site-s-content)</span>

That was the problem within my site.

In the navigation, the text *Need a Brand *linked to simply “/needabrand”.

In order to load the embed, I had to make sure it was going to an *external
*URL.

<span class="figcaption_hack">My Form [Page](http://www.jbonedesign.com/needabrand)</span>

Of course, it’s not really external. But Squarespace will load the page and thus
the embedded form differently, depending on how you are linking that page to
other pages.

*****

### How to Make Internal Pages External

Take a look at your navigation sidebar. You have different navigation options:
Main, Secondary, and Not Linked.

The Not Linked option is quite helpful in this case.

These are pages you want open to the public, but not linked on your site.

I dropped this page into the Not Linked section, created an *external *link in
the navigation called Need a Brand, and pointed to
[http://www.jbonedesign.com/needabrand.](http://www.jbonedesign.com/needabrand.)

Now I’m linking that all-important page to everything. With a lead-filtering
form like this, I can now concentrate on my messaging with no fear of an
in-bound client being abruptly turned away by white-space.

If you need a brand, by all means, [fill it
out](http://www.jbonedesign.com/needabrand).
