Sometimes we forget what it was like to start out in the design industry. For
some, it‚Äôs a rude awakening when the things we were taught in college aren‚Äôt how
it actually is out there.

For others, heading into the void alone is daunting when you are in charge of
your own design education. A lot of us are thrown into the ecosystem with no
idea how the design world actually works.

There is a little part inside of these people who are reaching out for help, and
there are plenty of people around capable of doing that. The [Compass of Design
Community](http://cmps.co/) was created to be the compass to guide designers in
the right direction.

#### So who did all this?

My name is Darian, I‚Äôm a Brand Identity Designer from the Pacific Northwest.

My mission is to empower other designers with the skills and resources they need
to defeat impostor syndrome and start designing with confidence.

I started the Compass of Design because I wanted to fix the gaps in design
learning.

People are trying their hardest to run creative freelancing businesses, trying
to market their skills and products, and level up their design skills. I wanted
to help them with that.

### How did it all start?

The[ Compass of Design Community](https://compassofdesign.com/community) started
at the near end of 2016 with a focus on empowering designers with the skills
they need to succeed.

Originally it was called the ‚Äú**Design with Confidence**‚Äù newsletter, and for a
few months, it worked that way.

But as things started to expand, more people were responding and sharing the
things that they struggle with and areas that would make that newsletter more
useful.

After nearly 6 months of writing, there were enough people who were craving more
interaction with me and the others on the list that I was able to open up the
Community. Leading up to this there were a few changes that needed to be made.

### Why create a design community?

The topics on the early newsletter were relatively disconnected from the other
topics being shared.

As the group started to expand, the tone, topic, and format of the newsletter
was being shaped directly from feedback that the subscribers were willing to
give. Even though the topics were helpful, it wasn‚Äôt meeting the group where
they were at.

Over time, questions were being asked multiple times and though I was answering
them, the best way to honor that was to talk about it in the newsletter.

There‚Äôs great things in being able to have a conversation with people who
connect over your newsletter.

A lot of the conversations I have had with others on their own newsletters have
built into some really good friendships and mentor opportunities for me. And I
have been able to connect with a few of you friends over the better half of a
year.

> What was missing was that all of my experience could only carry a person so far.

Creating the community was a priority because

#### 1: The conversations from the newsletter are no longer one sided

With people asking about the group and where others are at too, I figured the
best way for people to be able to see that is by opening a community group
specifically around design to have access to all of the others in the group.

Currently we‚Äôre getting close to 100 people from multiple backgrounds and
disciplines, and combined that creates over 2000 human years worth of experience
to draw from.

#### 2: Current design feedback channels are broken

If you‚Äôve tried posting work on Dribbble, Behance, Instagram or other places
looking for feedback on your work recently, you might notice the same 10 people
liking your shot immediately or the random comments coming in saying ‚Äúlooks
good! you should check out my new logo.‚Äù

> ‚ÄúGreat work!<br> Your projects are an inspiration to me.<br> Check out my recent
> project‚Äù

*Literally pulled that from Behance with the next 10 posts having the same exact
comment.*

Nowadays, anyone can create automation tools that look for things going up on
social media and leaving this comment on the next 100 posts.

A community is a collecting group of people focused around a specific area,
audience, or idea. For the Compass of Design, **our community is a group that is
focused on design feedback and marketing your skills**.

We want this to be a platform for people to be able to grow as designers,
**regardless of where your field is going to be in.**

### So how are we fighting to fix all of that?

*****

### The Compass of Design community group

The community is filled with web designers, web developers, graphic designers,
marketers, illustrators, beginners, all-stars, and hopefully you too.

We work on a topic each week from the newsletter and share design work for
feedback. We have a handful of useful channels [you can see
here](https://compassofdesign.com/community#more)

We‚Äôre not the only community out there for design, but the plan is to continue
**growing the platform into a powerhouse of resources** for many types of
designers out there

### Design with confidence course (coming soon)

We have the [Design with Confidence](https://compassofdesign.com/course) course
coming soon to help people who at just starting out in design.

Taking the idea from the newsletter, I wanted to make a course teaching the
founding principles of design from a branding designer‚Äôs perspective of being
self taught.

Currently, the progress on this is halted, but the course should be available
early 2018.
