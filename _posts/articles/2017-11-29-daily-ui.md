# What if you actually do 100 days straight of UI prompts?

Hello there. First of all, I finished the challenge but there was no way I
actually could do this on a daily basis. I mean on a daily daily basis.

I had this thought in my mind for a long time  â€” write about my experiences and
perceptions from the [Daily UI Challenge](http://www.dailyui.co/). It all
started around the last week in June when I finally decided to start this
challenge. I wanted to fill up my [Dribbble
profile](https://dribbble.com/smeyke) and learn how to use Adobe XD *(then still
in beta)*.

[#048](https://dribbble.com/shots/3813313-Daily-UI-048-Coming-Soon)</span>

If you look up the whole challenge and the shots on Dribbble, Behance or
wherever people post them you see pretty quickly that most of the people who are
doing the challenge quit after the first few days. The situation would be the
same for me if I actually tried to make them daily.

To the people who didnâ€™t try to do the challenge by themselves,  here is a quick
overview what 100 Days of UI means; You get an email during the weekdays with a
prompt. Sometimes there was only a title, sometimes there were short
explanations or ideas for the given task.

So the idea is that you make 100 various user interfaces. How you do them, if
you animate them or not, if they are super fancy or pretty simple  â€” doesnâ€™t
matter. After doing the UI you can share it with #dailyui on your preferred
platform. The whole idea behind this challenge is to become a better designer,
no matter of the current skill level.

Since I got my [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/smeyke) invite last February I
tried to fill it up with recent and interesting work I created. The classic
internet show off. These were mostly private or school projects (Iâ€™m in my last
year of education as an Interactive Media Designer right now). Then the fact
that we were slowly switching our design workflow at the office from
photoshop/sketch to the new Adobe XD. We kinda overstepped the whole Sketch
thingy and are too conservative for a tool like [Atomic](https://atomic.io/) or
[Figma](https://www.figma.com/)(yet). And the fact we knew XD would come to
Windows sometime (it actually is in beta right now). Anyhow, I knew XD would
stick for a while in the office culture and I wanted to get to know it pretty
well.

[#081](https://dribbble.com/shots/3908848-Daily-UI-081-Status-Update)</span>

Like I said before there was no way this could work daily. Sometimes I had
off-time in the office and could do one or two challenges but mostly there was
no space in my regular work day. But there are evenings and weekends, right?

I had some good days and some bad days. If I look back at the [project on
Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/smeyke/projects/543756-100-Days-of-UI) I see
mostly basic stuff. Nothing extremely fancy but not really bad work either. On
some days I wondered now how I could upload something like this (in a bad way),
like the flight search. I forgot the most important thing there, the
destinations. ðŸ˜† Okay, they were on it but super small.

Another cool thing was, that I could combine really cool stuff from friends or
bands into the UI. So I included [Free Clothing](http://freeclothing.co/) on the
email receipt or the band [UnderÃ¸ath](http://underoath777.com/) on the news
card.

Maybe I will redo this whole project in a few years. When I finally get to
motivation to learn proper motion design or a new super cool tool (like the one
from InVision) comes up. Iâ€™ll keep you updated. Thanks for reading.
