# Systems in design

## Making faster design decisions through automation

It‚Äôs a sticky place to be when you only have a few hours to get some design work
done. You might have been procrastinating or busy with other parts of your
process. Either way, you‚Äôre running short on time and you haven‚Äôt even started
on the design.

You then spend the first hour and a half getting your color palettes picked,
your grid lines set up, grabbing fonts, figuring out your typography scale‚Ä¶ the
list of things to do is endless.

Having systems in place to use during your design process is one of the best
ways to combat this endless battle of time. Steps in the design process that can
take a huge chunk of the clock to finish can be reduced to a fraction of the
time with a good system in place.

However, just like forming new habits, it‚Äôll take a bit of practice to make sure
that you have these systems in place before you get started on any work. And
with these systems, they can work for you or against you. They become ingrained
in your process through unconscious absorption or by your own conscious effort.

As long as you are working on putting effort in to adopting the system in your
process, you can start creating work that not only looks consistent, but more
thought out and feels natural to the intended viewer.

Over the next few weeks, we‚Äôll be pulling apart **Layout and Composition**,
**Visual Hierarchy**, and **Design Systems, **(all very large topics) to look at
some of the components inside.

> Those on the [Compass of Design
> newsletter](https://compassofdesign.com/community) have have seen these topics
in depth, but for those of you here, it‚Äôs a preview into the types of content we
go over.

Every working system has separate parts driving the machine. Systematizing these
parts of your design process not only speeds up your designs but creates a more
unified and effective solution to whatever problems you are trying to solve.

### Grids

Grids and guides are used in everything: icon design, print layouts, typography,
hand lettering, web design, photography. A well defined grid system can set up
anchors in your information and guide people through the ideas and concepts.

Whether it is your guides set up in Adobe Illustrator (using ‚ÄúGuide Guide‚Äù of
course) or using grid lined graph paper, having one in place will help create
more appealing content that engages people. Information that is consistently
laid out is easier to consume and take action upon. It‚Äôs true that just knowing
what a grid is won‚Äôt make you a good designer, but those who can use a grid
effectively will create astonishing designs, but they also know when it‚Äôs okay
to break the grid to make something truly unique.

Grids are one of the best systems you can use to guide people through content.
To use them, you have to have a good understanding of lines and shapes and their
usage in design (we‚Äôll go over this in depth during the [Designing with
Confidence course](https://compassofdesign.com/course)). They take the content
that you are designing for and helps you arrange things in logical order and
logical divisions.

### Sizing and Proportion

Both size and proportion have their place in visual hierarchy. How do you know
if something is sized properly? Does something feel off in your work?

Properly setting up a logical scale will help provide context to your work.

Every part of your design is connected. By changing even a tiny thing, you can
throw off the balance of the rest of the design. Design is something that is
judged as a whole, but these individual components will stick out like a sore
thumb should something be off balance with the rest of your design elements.

Having a system in place for choosing your sizing scale will help you eliminate
the guesswork and save you time in the long run. We‚Äôll soon go over some simple
patterns and ways you can test each one in a quick fashion.

### Visual Guidelines

A ‚Äúdesign system‚Äù sets everything up when you hand off your design to others who
are working on the same project. By having visual guidelines in place, you are
capable of keeping your design for the project intact after the hand-off.

Visuals are an important part of design, obviously. But without a system in
place to filter new ideas through, your next design might just end up ‚Äúoff
brand‚Äù and disconnected from the rest of the work.

A ‚Äúdesign system‚Äù is based on viewing the collection of individually designed
pieces as a whole. People will perceive a whole design system before they learn
to read into the different parts that make up the whole thing. You have direct
control on what that experience will be. Soon, we‚Äôll talk about visual
guidelines and how to set that holistic guideline correctly the first time.

*****

We can sometimes feel that working on these elements are super labor intensive.
However, I have found that by practicing each of these disciplines by setting up
templates and using proven methods, you can help your design reach the final
result much faster.

This is especially true if you have go to systems that are defined at the start
of your projects (before even moving the pen or mouse). It is a very nice
feeling knowing that when you have all the information from the project brief,
research, or brand audits, you can eliminate the guess work and get straight to
the actual design.
