# The 50+ tools that I use as an independent designer

The past two years have been crazy busy in my development as a designer. I
wanted to run through all of the equipment, services, and other tech I am using
to create all of my work. You would think that the role of a designer was just
creating small mockups or sketches and editing them in Adobe software to make it
look pretty.

If you‚Äôre already a designer, you are laughing pretty hard right now.

When we talk about our roles, we talk about more than just design because we
have to learn much more than just the basic skills to make it by in the real
world. I won‚Äôt lie; in order to make it out there you either have to be really
good at selling your craft, or your craft has to be so good it practically sells
itself.

There is a large blooming need for designers in business. This has created a
habit where we started fitting them anyway that we could into startups and
positions where their skills and workload are stretched very thin. Even the
solo-preneurs have found that you don‚Äôt just have to learn design, you will have
to eventually learn a lot of other stuff too.

### My journey started off in web design

I had plans on being in business for myself so that I could be doing something
at home and be around my son more often. I found that the best route to learn
was some type of design job that I could do remotely. I chose web design. I
built several websites over my first year. I bootstrapped my education by
sneaking some college syllabus‚Äô from college sites, spending thousands of hours
reading articles, distilling information so that I could improve my skills.

I moved into Brand Identity design because I feel that was my strong suit. Along
the journey there are plenty of things I had to learn how to do.

Below is the list of all of the things I currently use to do what I do. Only one
of these links is an affiliate link. Even then, I feel that someone wanting to
use these to do more or try how another designer is doing things is now
important than getting paid by it.

### Web Technology Stack

#### I run 3 of my own websites.

* [So Magnetic](http://somagnetic.com/) (rescinded the site during construction
period)
* [Compass of Design](http://compassofdesign.com/) (for the self-starter design
community)
* [My personal portfolio](http://darianrosebrook.com/) (for my current client
work)

#### Each site runs the same tech behind it.

* Hosted with [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) (until it outshines it‚Äôs
usefulness)
* Coded with [Jekyll](https://jekyll.tips/), [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/), HTML,
Javascript, jQuery, [masonry.js](http://masonry.desandro.com/layout.html) and
lots of sweat and tears.
* [Cloudflare
SSL](https://blog.cloudflare.com/secure-and-fast-github-pages-with-cloudflare/)
because the Let‚Äôs Encrypt SSL is out of my skillset right now
* My forms are done with [Formspree](https://formspree.io/) (paid account to get
multiple forms and no exposed email addresses)
* [mailchimp.](http://mailchimp.com/)com for subscription information (May change
to [convertkit](http://convertkit.com/), not sure yet.)

[cmps.co](http://cmps.co/)

### Web Apps and Software

#### There are a few web apps I use to keep myself up on the game.

* [Google](https://google.com/)‚Ä¶ because‚Ä¶ Google.

accounting

time saving tasks

#### My design programs

* Adobe CC suite:<br> Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe XD, Adobe
InDesign, Adobe Acrobat, Adobe After Effects, and TypeKit

my desktop screen
