# The hustle and the grind

## Like the tortoise and the haire, but told in a way that actually helps you move
forward and not burn out in a year

#### Tell me if this sounds familiar

> (if it‚Äôs not, let me know. I‚Äôm curious how your schedule works.)

* Wake up ~ 4‚Äì5am
* Eat breakfast and have coffee
* Work on side project stuff until 7:45 and get ready for work
* 8:30 show up at work
* *Mentally check out around 11am*
* Work on side project stuff during your 1hr lunch (and eat. come on guys, I‚Äôm
really not a robot)
* get back to work and leave at 6pm
* get home, spend time with the wife and child until bedtime ~9pm
* work until you pass out at your desk.

This was my basic schedule for my first year in design. I had Tuesdays and
Sundays to rest, but it wasn‚Äôt super healthy. After almost 1 year straight of
this, I burned out. I was done.

I thought about quitting design, my last effort I had to do something great for
my family before I give up to work my ‚Äúregular job‚Äù like my family raised me to
do. You know, the kind of day job that supposedly gives you $20 an hour and a
pension for working 35 years straight, along with side bonuses and profit
sharing, 2 weeks paid time off with insurance and family leave?

Yeah, that one only gave me $11/hr, denied a raise higher than $0.25/yr, even
denied promotion for almost 5 years because I was unwilling to force customers
to get products they didn‚Äôt want or need. I don‚Äôt know which sounded more like a
pipe dream, a successful ‚Äúday job‚Äù or going into business for myself as a
designer.

<span class="figcaption_hack">I actually do love my parents, but this was all too fitting of my early
upbringing.</span>

Constantly, I evaluate my goals and gauge if I am doing them because I wanted
to, I needed to, or it was just what sounded nice to be doing. During my earlier
part of my design career, I didn‚Äôt have people around me where I felt understood
or that could truly could help support me and figure out what to do.

If I was going to make it and do something worthwhile in my life, it was
entirely up to me.I know that I have potential, I know I have the work ethic to
get things done, I know that there are people counting on me to start growing up
and doing good work.

It was just going to take a lot of hard work and determination to grind my own
path towards my future.

### The grind

The grind is the starting point of everything you do when you get a new venture
going on.

You believe that every hour that you aren‚Äôt working, you are losing money. So
what do you do? You fill all of your available time, outside of work or family,
to get started on your side projects. You might have been conditioned for a very
long time that you are paid by the hour and so every hour has to be filled with
work.You are solely capable of doing everything yourself and getting things done
during this time.

The grind creates routine, you wake up early or stay up late, you start pounding
away at the task list and achieve a lot. This is how everyone starts, by
building up what they have with their own two hands.

For me things started getting difficult when I couldn‚Äôt get more work done in my
available time. So I had to work harder. I started waking up early *AND *staying
up late to get things done. I effectively doubled my output. So I started taking
on more responsibilities and taking on more design work outside of my job to get
things rolling. I started design challenges and effectively put myself in
another routine.

This can be immensely hard to escape from. You‚Äôre effectively using all the time
you have available without any regards to how long you can keep this up or if
it‚Äôs really being effective. But this is how you started, so if your goals and
needs change, maybe it‚Äôs time for you to change.

### The hustle

> Like the tortoise if you gave it a boosted-board instead of using stumpy little

The hustle is sometimes seen as synonymous to ‚Äúthe grind.‚Äù These two terms are
actually quite different things.

As we continue down our journey, we tend to somehow figure out that the way we
are grinding away at our task list isn‚Äôt working out very well for us. We need
to figure out how to do more with what we have. This can be very difficult to
see as you start out, but as you grow through your journey, you start to realize
there are things you could do if you didn‚Äôt have to spend that time doing
something somewhere else.

You have to work smarter, not harder.Working smart means taking account of the
things you are currently doing and measuring their effectiveness of reaching
your goals.I had to do this with the way that I‚Äôm currently spending time with
things in my business.

Areas where I was spending all my time doing one task repeatedly (like setting
up grids in Photoshop/Illustrator, creating title cards for my newsletter, new
client onboarding, countless other things) were bottle-necking how effective I
could be at getting more effective tasks done, (like client work, onboarding new
community members, creating new products).

Eventually you can get to a point where you are able to delegate tasks to others
or even hire other companies or services/software to do things that your time is
better spent not doing.

### Where are you?

At the end of the day, are you doing everything you can to get the work done
that you need to?

Both the hustle and the grind have their application in your life. You start
with the first and move on to the second. As you start to grow or if you start
to level out, burn out, or feel like quitting, spend some time evaluating your
routine and if you are working harder not smarter.

This is really about priorities and doing what is more important first. It‚Äôs
fine if you have helpers, but if you don‚Äôt you really have no choice but to do
everything yourself but prioritized by importance.

Perhaps you can hire ppl to do stuff around the house and that will free up your
time. I‚Äôm more a self-fixer but I know my limits and will find help for bigger
tasks.

This is true. For me, it‚Äôs really easy to procrastinate even when I do get up
early/stay late. Starting to implement ‚Äúfocus cards‚Äù that keep me on task.
