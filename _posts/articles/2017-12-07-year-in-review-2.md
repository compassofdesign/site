# I just completed two years of moonlighting as a freelance designer.

## And what building two design focused businesses at the same time looks like.

Two years ago in this first week of December, I started learning to code
websites. I had my eyes set on becoming a freelance web designer.

The glam and glory was appealing, meaning that I was able to do something that
interested me (finally) and get paid handsomely to do so.

This path has set me on one of the best and trying journeys of my life. Along
the way I have met new and interesting people. I’ve failed at a handful of
things that opened it’s way to new things or trying again from different angles.


I’ve built and perfected processes that make building two businesses at the same
time less stressful than it was starting out.

[That story has been told in my first year’s year-end
review](https://read.compassofdesign.com/year-zero-my-journey-as-a-designer-a172342e3ee3),
geared towards helping new people to the web design industry.

### 2017 was a good year

#### But it was the most challenging of them all

I have been able to accomplish so much, yet not enough. It’s felt fulfilling,
yet severely lacking. And I’ve been growing a lot, all while standing still.
I’ve been making money as a designer, but I’m not quite where I need to be to
sustain all this.

### Let’s talk.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*VhoE7JmWYNvFZpxEaaVM3A.gif)

### This year started out great too.

I had a long sit down at the end of 2016 after spending nearly all of my free
time working months on the redesign of an enormous web app as the only designer
on the project.

This project left me with time in order to focus on continuing my learning of
design, no time to build my business on the side while working with KeySpark and
my full time job, no time for my family.

And I had to really consider if now was the right time for me to become a web
designer.

When you are trying to build your business on the side of having 2 day jobs (A
bank teller and a web designer for a remote dev agency) you start to have scope
creep, but for your obligations in life.

If I were to survive, I would need to focus.

#### That was this year. Focus.

After a sit down talk with a friend who had been a designer for years before
starting her family, she had mentioned to me that there are more things to
design than just websites.

She had me audit what I was doing, where I was spending most of my time, where
my heart was at with everything, and then imagine myself if I went that
direction for the next 15–20 years.

Was that line of work going to satisfy my urge to create? Could I keep up with
the rapid growth and iteration of the design world? What if what I’m good at
designing isn’t hot anymore? Do I have the ability to change? Do I have the
skills right now to be creating timeless designs?

These hard questions got me to audit what I was doing and what my true goals
were with being a designer.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*XE_gitQYI7AuP3TrgqLCVA.jpeg)

### The Plan

It’s like I had suddenly started to see what I wanted to do in life. It’s a
really weird and fulfilling thing when you have the pieces of what you do and
who you’re best equipped to help cross each other.

#### I had two goals

1.  Improve my professional process to move into the premium market of designers,
building out the foundation to start a branding design agency focused on helping
businesses transition from a small mom-and-pop into something more professional
or corporate.
1.  Build a platform to help designers who can’t afford design school (or want to
teach themselves) learn how to effectively build their skills, market themselves
better, becoming a better professional in the process.

### The Coach

Back in December of 2016, my friend [Justin Jackson
](http://justinjackson.ca)had been opening up slots in his mentorship coaching
group he was starting. This group was a run of four months of personalized
coaching, goal setting, group Q&A events, and progress checking.

This kickstarted my year with some heavy goals and ambitions that I knew I had
the ability to finish. But Justin, seeing what I planned to do, knew that I
would be burning myself out if I hadn’t fixed my current work situation.

I was exhausted all the time, working my butt off for a ~$17,500 take home
income along with working a second job that was barely paying anything better
than that.

If I was going to be focusing on growing my business, I had to make sure my day
job income was taking care of my base costs.

Had I relied on my side income to pay bills, I would have damaged my passion to
do this venture.

Your side-hustle, when starting out, is like a sapling. If you try to lean up
against it, it’s going to snap like a twig and become crushed.

When you have the business where it can support your current lifestyle without
the use of you business income, along with a solid foundation (months of income
saved in the bank) and a steady stream to nurture it, you are able to leave the
day job.

I was currently using too much of that side income and needed to cut to bare
necessities and focus on increasing my income on both fronts.

### Great minds think better together

After the coaching started, we formed an online mastermind meetup where the
people who were in the coaching sessions would meetup on a video hangout every
week to share progress and gain feedback on our projects.

The people in the group were mainly developers who each had some sort of SaaS
Product (software as a service) or product they were selling.

Our goals this year was to make a sustainable living on the things we love to
do, and build out new ideas to test.

As I was working on all the things that resulted from my coaching sessions with
Justin, this group was a way to keep myself more accountable to the goals, along
side that I was paying a lot of money in order to have access to the things I
was doing.

The advice and feedback from both sides of this coin (Mentorship and Mastermind)
was exactly what I needed to give me the motivation to build out and test the
feasibility of my ideas and fed each other into what naturally happened.

### My design business split into two sides of the same coin

These businesses feed each other.

One of them does branding design engagements with clients

The other shares the experiences, knowledge, and fosters growth around becoming
a more professional designer.

#### How do they feed into each other?

In order to build [Compass of design](https://compassofdesign.com), I had to:

* design the logo and build a branding design system
* build the site
* design a branded email template
* design branded title cards for the newsletters
* build and design custom tools for the site to be used
* create automation campaigns, sales funnels, and track analytics
* branded products
* social media profiles

In order to build [So Magnetic](https://somagnetic.com) I needed to:

* learn to build a more professional process
* learn to position myself with high value design clients
* learn to price on value to the client rather than arbitrary rates
* learn how to fit heavy hitting projects in my currently overloaded schedule

### Rebranding the newsletter

> You have a lot of thoughts, ideas, and experiences locked inside of your head
> and most of them will die with you.

> — Sean McCabe

This newsletter isn’t something that I wanted to do solely for myself. Plenty of
people could benefit hearing from someone who is in the fight, working on
creating a design business from the ground up, learning about design along the
way and then turning around and teaching what he’s learned.

The path to becoming a designer is also very hazy and not well documented
outside of the college/design school setting.

I wanted to be able to be a guide to show these people who are eager to learn,
but lost without an idea of where to go. I wanted to create the compass that
guides them.

This turned into changing my focus on writing about Designing with Confidence,
to me helping people find the direction they needed to go to level up their
design skills.

> (Yeah the newsletter was originally called Designing with Confidence)

In order for me to teach design to others, I had to become a perpetual design
student.

There will always be something to add on a topic, because even if someone else
has written about it, done a talk on it, created that theory before, there’s no
new ideas out in the world any more. Just a fresh perspective.

I would say that running my design newsletter has been the quickest and most
efficient way for me to learn design.

As the newsletter grew, so did the position of the brand. Ideally, the brand is
a way to help empower other designers with the skills they need to defeat
impostor syndrome and start designing with confidence.

New things were added every week to this brand until it became it’s own full
standalone thing, all seated within it’s parent brand** So Magnetic.**

### [The Compass of Design](https://compasofdesign.com)

At a certain point, I had several people who were on the newsletter that had
started asking questions about the other people on the newsletter.

Questions like:

* What are the other people struggling with?
* What types of designers are on this list?
* Am I the only one who has problems with this?

These questions had got me thinking that I was hitting close to the right spot
with the positioning of my newsletter. But someone can only get so far on the
thoughts and insight of one person.

So I decided in April to open up the newsletter list and start a private slack
community for the people who signed up for the newsletter.

#### The Community

The group started growing very slowly for the first few months.

Originally I was sending invites to anyone who joined the newsletter. The amount
of accepted invites compared to the actual signups were about 1 signup to every
4 or 5 that joined the newsletter.

At a certain point (and I can’t remember when) I added a little checkbox that
said “also, send me a Compass of Design Community invite” which worked better so
that I was only sending invites to those who wanted it.

But then again that only worked a little bit better.<br> By the time we got to
50 people in the community, I had started dealing with a few really negative
people that made it into the community.

This was a group I built to foster growth and I ended up having to talk to a few
members individually, I had to kick one person out of the group, another left of
his own accord.

And that got me thinking of the value that you get being for being a community
member. This thing is meant to help foster the growth of your skills and help
you become a better designer overall faster. All while building friendships,
acquaintances, skills, getting valuable feedback on work you’re doing.

I decided to close open registration for the community back in August, and new
members were only added if they messaged me personally asking to get in.

I did something soon after. I started charging new members for community
membership. This did 2 things.

1.  Something that is open to everyone is open to both the good and the bad people.
By charging for community membership, I was able to help improve the quality by
challenging people to be serious about wanting to become a better designer.
1.  The increase in income from membership helps me focus exclusively on helping
these people grow and continue to invest back into them. Makes me want to invest
things like giving free goods, free course material, all sorts of stuff. It
improves the quality of the community membership on both fronts.

As of this article, the community has grown to almost 75 people. All of you in
there are founding members of something great to come. I hope you all continue
to participate and grow together over the next year.

#### The Products

Products like the design resources will continue to be added as they come
available. I plan on finishing the other two on the list soon and I hope to
continue to add as many resources as people need.

#### The Coaching

I have plans for two courses.

1.  **Marketing yourself as a designer** (50% built out)
1.  **Designing with Confidence: The founding principles of design** (25% built)

I also plan on expanding on a few of the topics of 2017 in video form on
YouTube.

I’ll open up myself for private mentoring and coaching sessions through my
personal site where people can sign up to get specific and specially tailored
feedback and goals directly from me.

I plan on trying to get some small gigs teaching what I know in workshops both
online and in person.

There is so much in store for the Compass of Design and community as the brand
continues to grow. You’ll see my goals at the end of the post.

### Rebranding my design business

This meant that along with changing the position of my design newsletter, in
order to reach a higher market of design clients, I had to increase my
professionalism.

Positioning was key, so in order to level up with my design business, I had to
start reverse engineering what a successful branding agency has.

#### Qualities of an agency afloat

1.  Excellent communication skills between the client and designer
1.  A higher level of design skills than where I am right now.
1.  The ability to uncover goals, expectations and price based on goals and expected
value of the project
1.  The ability to employ design strategy through a consistent professional process
1.  Being selective with taking on clients
1.  Extreme confidence and backing of choices made
1.  A large body of work that compliments and assures clients they’re making the
right choice
1.  Effective case studies that entice, explain, and convert visitors to start new
projects
1.  A clear and direct niche
1.  An excellent brand positioning statement

I am nowhere near finishing all of the things on this list. But, with what I
have completed, I have become a much better designer and business person through
it.

I’ve been doing what I can to position my brand here in a niche market

<span class="figcaption_hack">But even then it’s insanely hard to pick a positioning statement. So why not use
all of them? </span>

> Yeah that hasn’t been quite as effective as I would have liked it to be. haha

#### The Target Market

<br>

#### The Services

#### The Change in Professionalism

This year has been great for becoming a better professional. <br> <br>

hindered in society. Thank you.

remember right now as I’m building this article) If you and I have interacted at

### My vision for next year

For next year, I want to be able to finally retire the dayjob.

Anyone who does know me knows that I usually go to bed around 10 or 11pm and
wake up around 4 am to get working on my design business.

That has to stop. I can only do this for so long until my body gives out.

#### **Next year I plan on 10x-ing my design business**

This will mean:

* Getting my case studies onto my website
* Leveraging referrals and outbound marketing efforts as well as inbound marketing
efforts
* Building up a cash reserve that equates to 6 or more months of all expenses at
my current lifestyle level
* Building up a cash flow to sustain that cash reserve or blow it to bigger
proportions
* Pricing on value rather than time or flat fee (that means not over charging my
clients, and not undercharging myself)

#### Next year I plan on 10x-ing the value behind Compass of Design Community
Membership making it a better investment for new members (and current ones)

This will mean:

* Sending out free stuff like stickers, pins, and digital goods to the [members of
the community](https://compassofdesign.com/community) (still deciding on
semi-annually or quarterly.)
* Finishing the Designer’s Self Assessment Tool’s second version to include a much
better learning path that is custom tailored to a person’s level of experience
and chosen design discipline
* Start doing more things like live events and group challenges
* Explore what the platform can become and start the vision of what version 2.0 of
the community looks like and how to grandfather what ever group exists into that
new version
* Continue to do the things that drive the most value to members of the audience
* Make many new friends

I am so excited for where this is going. I hope that you’ll all come with me and
work on your projects like I am.

I want to thank you for everything you as an audience has given me in support.
Without it, this would be a very dull adventure.
