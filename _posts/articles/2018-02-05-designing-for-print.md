# Print design tips for the digital age

## How to avoid some common pitfalls that we might otherwise miss

I’ve been designing websites for the past 2.5 years and focused on logo design
and branding for the past year. Though those digital skills will never leave me
if I continue to use them, I haven’t built up the right amount of skills in
order to prepare digital files for printing.

With that being said, in my line of work as a branding designer, it’s in my best
interest to learn about this and focus on building some general knowledge that
will help me survive when a client asks for new packaging or needs to have files
ready for printing companies.

When we’re going through client work (or if you’re being asked by your company)
to create logo designs or branding, you need to know just what caveats and
pitfalls exist when it comes to designing for print.

You control the cost for printing through your designs, so having as much
knowledge about it can help you and the businesses you design for control budget
for years of ongoing work.

I’m always excited when I have something new and useful to learn. As I start to
build up that knowledge, I’m going to be sharing what I’ve found and what I’ve
learned as a result of working with three different printing methods, designing
for physical goods.

**I put myself through the process of working with:**

* [Sticker Mule](https://www.stickermule.com/)** **— for custom cut stickers (Die
Cut and Kiss Cut)
* [Made by Cooper](https://www.madebycooper.com/)** **— for 2 custom hard enamel
lapel pins
* [Rise and Shine Letterpress](http://www.riseandshinepaper.com/)** **— for custom
designed pin backing cards

Though I will walk you through the process of designing each of these pieces
soon, I wanted to make sure you knew some of the best practices for preparing
your work-space for print in order to start getting into those details.

### We love to create digital gold.

However, not every print job is capable of displaying that properly when printed
in nearly every method available.

Having the right mindset about what you need to do in order to have a file
that’s ready for print is the first step to creating a successful physical
design.

There are physical limitations to that different methods have to adhere to,
which without massive technological advancement are the standard acceptable
limits.

Consider that something you design may end up:

* Reproduced in Black and White
* Stitched into the tags of clothing
* Put onto t-shirts and other textiles
* Butchered by the client on their home printer
* In very small sizes not intended for the design
* Impossible to match the color you saw on your screen

These scenarios are not exact to what you might get in the wild, but it’s
entirely possible.

Let’s look at some of the best ways to safeguard against the worst case
situations.

### Sketch out your ideas before going to digital.

There is something freeing about not having digital tools that hold you back
from being creative.

[We’ve talked about why you should always start sketching
first](https://read.compassofdesign.com/stop-getting-stuck-on-your-digital-design-concepts-6aff4ef6d042),
but the goal is to not box us into a design idea too early and not get bogged
down by tools. Tools are less important than the idea.

This kind of process also helps you keep the message simple. You get to play a
lot with balance by creating simple blocks and testing what works and what might
not work.

When you move to digital to prepare the file for the printer, you don’t have to
spend all the time in the file trying to figure out what layout, style, or size
to make things.

When you are working with actual sizes, it’s best to test your layout just using
marker and paper that is close to or exactly the size you intend on designing
for.

### You need to know the limits of what you’re designing for

Every design process has limits. Some processes just have more, like designing
for print.

> You can’t do everything you can on paper like you can on a screen. The
> technology just doesn’t support it.

Knowing the limits that constrain what’s possible actually forces you to be more
creative.

As a general rule, here are some situations that make any print job a headache
to run with the printer:

1.  **Very Small Typography**Very small type can be rendered illegible due to the
fact that ink tends to bleed, smudge, or smear. Even the natural thin and thick
lines in typefaces can disappear.
1.  **Ultra Thin Printed Lines or Ultra Thin Margins**There’s something called
hairline registration that allows two colors to come close to each other but not
overlap. And with some printing processes, you will never be able to do that
accurately while some print shops have ways of achieving that type of
registration. However, a line that is ultra thin may have trouble making it
through the printing process in tact. Make sure you ask the printer what the
minimum line-weight is.
1.  **Color Matching**<br> There are very few methods of attaining accurate colors
in print design. Ink is inherently translucent where digital colors with visual
displays are capable of much more than printers can achieve. Therefore we have
specific color methods to print with.

If you don’t know what is possible or what isn’t, it’s your job to figure that
out and understand it. Maybe **consult with the place that is going to print
your work** in order to find out what you can do.

Other than calling them and asking, you can always look at their work, reviews,
online tutorials on that method of printing. Print has been around for longer
than digital, so the amount of resources available are endless.

### Use the right settings

When taking your sketch to digital, there are a few things you need to
understand about printing.

1.  **We are desgining physical objects.**<br> These objects are going to have
actual dimensions, so instead of working in pixels, you will want to select the
right units for what you’re working on or set the units into those of the place
you’re getting this printed. Common units are Inches, Feet, Meters, Centimeter,
Millimeter, and Points. If you’re curious about what the common settings are,
check with the printer or search online.
1.  **DPI and PPI should be at 300. **<br> The units for how dense the design’s
pixels or points (dots) are per inch determine the quality resolution of what is
being printed. Printers generally work at 300 or higher, so anything less than
that will be grainy or pointilized.
1.  **Your color profile has to be CMYK compatible**<br> We had a tutorial on this
newsletter that will need to be updated, but the idea of CMYK color vs RGB color
is that RGB is an additive color process that starts as black pixels (not lit
up) and you have to light all three colors to get white and every hue between.
CMYK is a subractive process so you start with white and then every color you
add makes it darker and closer to black — If you’re wondering what color profile
you’re already in, you might be able to see at the top of your document like in
Adobe Illustrator. It has the file name and then the profile of color being
used.

### Three registration lines to include with your files

When you have a digital file, you control how the design is cut, where the
placements are. However, when designing for print, these luxuries go out the
window.

More than likely your work is going through a high production printer which
carries a lot of speed. Therefore, accuracy is corrected by using an area that
measures bigger than the original design to fit everything in the right areas.

1.  **Bleed Area**<br> This is the area for designs that extend from edge to edge
(or over the edge). When the paper moves through the printer, sometimes a shift
occurs which would displace the accuracy of your edges.<br> Therefore, in order
for your design to truly be edge to edge, you must extend the design past where
you thought it should be cut. A common bleed area is 1/8" or 3 mm to avoid
excess printing which increases costs.
1.  **Trim Line**<br> This red area within the outer bleed area is where you plan
for your design to be cut. Sometimes there are markers placed on the outer edge
to help align the cutting tool for the work. Important information or pieces of
the design should stay away from this line in order to avoid the design getting
cropped incorrectly if the paper shifts.
1.  **Safe Area**<br> This is why we have the bleed area. But for those who have
artwork that absolutely must be on the page and can’t risk being cropped we have
this area. The safe area is within the trim area, usually the same width away
inside the trim line as the bleed area (1/8" or 3mm). This allows your work’s
important content to avoid being cropped should the marginal discrepancies of
trimming be enough to be worried about it.

Trim is so miniscule of a difference though, looking at the results of business
cards from 2 years ago. You can see that the trim at the top 3 elements is
varying thicknesses which just show how much can change in the pinting process.

### Outline your fonts before sending the files.

I can almost guarantee that your print company doesn’t have that fancy font you
downloaded last week from Creative Market.

So when they go to open your file, it will make them choose a substitute font if
it doesn’t already break the file on their end.

To avoid this, all of your text should be saved as their shapes instead of text.

So if you use text in your files or even complex lines, it is probably good to
turn those into solid shapes to avoid any unwanted file breaking or changing
typefaces or line widths.

### Double check everything.

Don’t send your file off without checking these things

* That the right color profile was used (CMYK)
* That you are using 300dpi/ppi or higher
* That you have all text and complex line work outlined as shapes
* That you created the document at the right size and with the right units
* That you’re not doing something crazy that the print method can’t do like using
blend modes and crazy gradients
* That all of the elements are where they should be on the page
* That you have the proper bleed areas, trim lines, and content’s safe area

And on top of checking all of that, sometimes the printing company will send
their own proof before production. Always double check those with the original
design. Make sure that you check off the list there too.

If you feel like you might need more info about any one of these areas, let me
know and I can expand on these topics.

#### When in doubt, call your local print company!
