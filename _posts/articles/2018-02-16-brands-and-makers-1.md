# Great Brands & their Makers: Starbucks

## Brands that transcend their visual presence and embed themselves squarely in
culture

### Indisputably Influential

In the 80's, Italian coffee culture inspired then Director of Marketing Howard
Schultz to introduce espresso drinks to American culture. It didn’t take then
but its time was yet to come. (En.wikipedia.org, 2018)

Schultz set a tone, distinguishing between American diner Joe and Italian
doppio. Every time (and it is often) I see a working-class yankee asking for a
venti water to go with a grande dark roast, I am blown away at Schultz’s vision.
Some time in the 90’s we all agreeably started speaking Italian. And sort of
condescend to people who don’t.

arguably add its own name to the American tripod of baseball, mamas and apple
pie?

### Brand Makers

The visual Starbucks brand has had a few iterations, but each time it stayed
true to its original identity: embodiment of

> a unique sense of adventure, specifically the seafaring history that reflected
> Seattle’s position…(Forbes.com. 2018)

Together, let’s break down the brand strategy and the creative partners within.

<span class="figcaption_hack">Original logo drawn by Terry Heckler (Hecklerassociates.com, 2018)
(Deadprogrammer.com, 2018)</span>

#### Initial Concept (1971)

I found **Heckler Associates** (then Heckler/Bowker) as one of the first
agencies to partner with Starbucks. At this time, I’ll point you to a very
compelling case study at
[www.hecklerassosciates.com/brand-stories/starbucks](http://www.hecklerassosciates.com/brand-storeies/starbucks),
from which much of this story is derived.

According to CEO Howard Schulz, **Terry Heckler**

> pored over old marine books until he came up with a logo based on an old
> 16th-century Norse woodcut: a two-tailed mermaid. (Klara, 2018)

Co-founder Gordon Bowker became tired of driving to Vancouver, B.C. from Seattle
every month to get good coffee. This motivated him to incorporate the s*eafaring
history, *mentioned above, into the original concept. (Hecklerassociates.com,
2018)

<span class="figcaption_hack">Il Giornale logo (left) and Starbucks logo (right) were both designed by Doug

<span class="figcaption_hack">Fast drew this logo with hand drawn typography based on the typeface Franklin
Gothic. (Image: Hecklerassociates.com, 2018) (Content: Deadprogrammer, 2018)</span>

### **Italian-Infused Brand (1985)**

As mentioned earlier, marketing director Howard Schultz pitched selling espresso
in the non-beverage stores. Separately, Schultz seemed so sold on this that he
created Il Giornale. Cue Heckler Associates once more. (Hecklerassociates.com,
2018)

**Doug Fast** of then Heckler-Bowker created Il Giornale’s logo that was bought
by Starbucks. Upon acquisition, Italian culture fused with on-the-go American
culture. With great rapidity, stores opened all across the nation.

### The Third Place (1996)

To start, here are some questions that verify Starbucks’s influential reach:

* Before the 90’s, where did you go to catch up with an old friend?
* Before the 90’s, where did you conduct a job interview outside the office?
* Before the 90’s, who made your coffee on a long road trip?
* If Apple had pushed mobile computing a decade earlier, where would we work
outside of the office?

And so, Starbucks became the New Third Place. The brand vision of Starbucks in
the late 90’s was to be the public hang out between work and home. Jerome Conlon
writes about this vision at **Goodby Silverstein and Partners**, likening it to
Roman forums, English pubs, Italian piazzas, German bier gardens, Japanese tea
houses. Americans, it seemed, lacked a third place. His research revealed that a
core opportunity for Starbucks is to position the brand

> …where people went to nurture their own sense of soulfulness. To pause in their
> day, rescript their plans, to reflect on new creative challenges, to have
animated conversations. (Anon, 2018)

### Refresh (2011)

**Lippincott **spearheaded the 2011 brand refresh. Much has been written on the
“slight imperfection” of the latest design, but I think it was an interesting
and compelling design choice. The designers at Lippincott felt the mermaid was
too perfect. Bogdan Geana, design partner, says

> In the end, just for the face part of the drawing, there’s a slight asymmetry to
> it. It has a bit more shadow on the right side of the face…It felt a bit more
human, and felt less like a perfectly cut mask. (Forbes, 2018)

The wavy mermaid hair from the original Heckler nautical concept was used as a
graphic pattern on tumblers. By taking out the text, the siren insists you read
it as “Starbucks Coffee.” (Lippincott, 2018)

### Back to its Roots

To come full circle, Schultz is pensively making his entrance in Italy. Well
aware of the contrast between Starbucks’ grab-and-go culture and Italian mid-day
reverence for espresso, Schultz knows

> We have to earn the respect. (Yardley, 2018)

And so, in late 2018, a Milan Starbucks will find major competition in the rich
history of coffee bars spotted throughout the country since the introduction of
the magic bean to the west.* (NPR.org, 2018)

**Somewhere in my memory there’s a fact of Eastern traders coming to Venice and
selling coffee. The pope was wary of it until he tasted and blessed it. Perhaps
Schultz knew of the unifying effect coffee has and hopes Italians embrace his
brand of coffee.*

### Stats

I’ll conclude with some numbers. This solidifies how far-reaching the brand
really is.
