# Position yourself as a professional designer

## Onboarding new design clients: part 2

When we talked last week, we said that a great designer can be measured by the
quality of the questions they ask.

> While this is true, being able to ask good questions is only a small part of the
> formula for becoming a great designer.

Another measure of a great designer is how well they can position themselves as
a professional to the person hiring them.

### Being a professional is much more than having a suit and a tie…

**A professional **is someone who holds themselves to a high standard *AND
***can achieve those standards **of their industry. A professional recognizes
where the responsibilities lie and taking accountability for them with their
actions.

You must make deliberate choices as a designer from your own evaluations or
you’ll have those choices made for you.

#### As a designer, the first step to becoming a professional is to believe in
yourself.

> If you carry yourself as a professional, your clients will start to see you as a
> professional. It starts with belief in yourself.

If you aren’t able to start believing in the work you are doing, you’re going to
have a difficult time moving past an amateur level.

For anyone who has had to interact with clients, **the ability to be a good
facilitator **will be crucial to have the client see you as the professional.

### It starts with the first impression.

Taking on new clients should be a focus for any freelancer or agency. The amount
of [effort you put into your onboarding
experience](https://cmps.co/client-onboard-1) will determine how the prospective
client will measure your level of expertise.

A first impression can make or break the first interaction that someone has with
you and your brand.

From the moment they enter your site, see you in person, or hear about you from
others, you are on the clock to make a good first impression. **The more premium
the experience, the smoother the transition you’ll have **going from their first
interaction to winning their business as a client.

**A few things influence the first impression**: your portfolio, your case
studies, your mission statement, your elevator pitch, and the questionnaire or
process you start someone out with. Somewhere in the list, your next client will
be introduced to you, your services, and your brand. But here’s the thing…

> Your client doesn’t want to hear how great you are. They are looking to you
> because they want to know how you can solve their problems.

How effectively you can communicate what you can do for clients will determine
how comfortable someone will be in hiring you.

Usually, **the person who can define the problem or opportunity with the most
clarity will get the job.**

> How you define the opportunity that the client has determines the way you will
> solve it.

#### Your website should be presenting professional level work.

[We had talked about ways to make a portfolio that
converts](http://cmps.co/portfolio-that-converts) in order to start **getting
more** or **better quality work**.

Now we just need to start leveling up that work and **making sure that every bit
of your design or case study is focused and presented in the best way
possible**.

You need to be using professional mockups to showcase your work. That work would
best be accompanied by a case study to show your process.

Your portfolio is an acquisition channel to be used to gain new clients, make
sure you put the effort in upfront and keep it updated with your best work.

### They say that the customer is always right.

This may be true in many cases, and it will be true with the people you are
designing for, but with all the status they get with working with you, it’s not
their fault if something falls through the cracks.

> If you want to position yourself as a professional, you have to be comfortable
> with taking responsibility for the whole experience.

#### It takes very little to see someone as an equal.

If you treat everyone as customers, you’re labeling them as another transaction
instead of a person who you’re invested in working with. Though the client may
be coming to you with their self-addressed solution, it would be a disservice to
not ask more questions to get to know them and the project they are working on.

Rather than serving a customer what they want, **you are serving your client by
focusing and discovering what’s best for them in through your process.**

#### Work on setting the roles and responsibilities as early as you can.

You need to be on the same page with your client on who’s responsible for parts
of the process. A designer then can determine the means of communication, times
of availability, methods of payment, etc.

Don’t leave any stone unturned or you might find yourself surprised when the
client tries to take control of a part of your process.

> Clients are going to assume responsibility for anything that you haven’t purely
> defined

> It’s your job to set expectations

Most of the time, your client doesn’t do this with the intent to be rude. They
want to help. But **if you don’t set how the process should go, your client will
**be left to make that part of the process their own. How you communicate has a
direct influence on how professional you come across, especially if you work
with international clients.

I get asked sometimes how to get work with clients in a different country. **To
be able to work internationally you have to be really good at communicating with
them in their language.** You have to treat your interaction with a level of
professionalism that you can “wow” the person hiring you.

Even if you don’t focus on international clients, you need to be able to
communicate with them as professionally as possible. Impress them with your
professional service.

### Don’t make the client do your job

You are being hired because there’s a level of work that you do that this person
either doesn’t know how to do, or doesn’t have the time to do.

**A good client is someone who values their time**, otherwise they would be
trying to do the very thing you were being hired to do without you.

Some people struggle with this because they haven’t discovered exactly what they
are best equipped to take care of. It would be wise to work on understanding how
the work you do affects the company, brand, or industry you will be working in.
This can be with reading on what the people you design for (both the client’s
business and their customers) deal with on a daily basis.

This will provide context to your work, and as you grow your skills over time,
**spend time trying to understand the metrics to which your design will be
measured.**

#### You are a professional, you just have to act like it

Because you’re being hired for your expertise, you’re bringing a level of
professionalism with you. However, if you are having to run to the client with
every decision along the way, you undermine the value of your work, and it also
devalues the client’s time.

If you need opinions on the work you’re doing, it helps to have people you trust
that you are able to ask. I’m not saying that you never ask the client anything,
either, but your process should have enough practice to get these questions
upfront when you go through project discovery.

Rather than just designing nice visuals, your work is focused on attaining a
goal that is important to the client. You need to have the client’s best
interest in mind.

So by just making something pretty, **you are subjectively projecting what you
prefer instead of designing based on the client’s needs.**

You can discover these needs with your questionnaires, your discovery process,
or just by simply asking what they plan on focusing on in the future of their
business.

> Spend time this week looking at the way you present yourself as a designer.

#### Areas to look at are:

* **Your case studies**: can your client see themselves going through the same
process and getting the same results as your previous clients?
* **The actual display of your work:** Are you using professional mockups or
real-life applications of your design?
* **Your communication: **Are you always patient and professional in the ways that
you communicate?
* **With responsibilities:** Are you making the design process for the client as
friction-less as possible?

### You are in charge of the impressions you make as a designer.
