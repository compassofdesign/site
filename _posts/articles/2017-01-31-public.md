title: Iterate in public - closing the gap from idea to execution
description: Having a great idea is worth very little unless you plan on executing it. You could have an idea that would change the way clean water is spread through disparate countries, but unless you have the confidence to seek out how to execute it, that idea is just another passing thought.

# Iterate in public: closing the gap from idea to execution

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*VKgpPmoE749gkMrZGF9Mbw.jpeg)

Having a great idea is worth very little unless you plan on executing it. You
could have an idea that would change the way clean water is spread through
disparate countries, but unless you have the confidence to seek out how to
execute it, that idea is just another passing thought. Once you act on that
those thoughts, even a rudimentary execution starts to increase the value of
your idea. Start iterating your ideas out in public.

It’s not easy to put your early work out there, but for most things, it’s great
to iterate and act on these ideas in public. There are plenty of benefits from
putting the work you do out into the world than bottling your idea for “later.”

### Giving your “great idea” value

At times, I wonder how many people have had the same idea that I recently had.
It’s not anything new to start thinking about becoming more confident as a
designer. It’s not new to have an idea of a newsletter about design, nor are the
topics I write about new topics. There’s really nothing new under the sun except
me. I’m the outlier and I am in charge of my idea’s execution.

Having the idea is a great place to start. This beautiful idea is planned and
mapped out in your mind. It could be an ongoing conversation between you and a
friend where each person builds that idea up. However, having an idea sitting in
your mind has one big flaw: it’s untested. And being untested means it has a
very small chance of succeeding if you go all out without testing it.

Best person I know about executing an idea is [Justin
Jackson](https://twitter.com/mijustin) and his [MegaMaker
List](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16gVonXDjdvlj6yBP-hOmbktugZ3-QkLOw_nhRN9xlUs/edit?usp=sharing).
He set out to make 100 things during the year. This is a goal that was pretty
ambitious because he would have to make 1 thing every three days. The reason I
started following him and his work was because he would take one or more of
these ideas every week and execute on them, reporting his progress back in the
form of a podcast. He would test each idea by actually going out and doing it.
Each execution was a new iteration which would lead him to closing that gap
between the idea and the execution.

This is what I set out to do, I take my inexperience as a designer and I turn
that into my strength. I iterate by taking what I learn and apply it to the work
I am currently doing. Then I bundle what I learn, write an article about it,
then I send that out in a newsletter fixed around a topic of becoming more
confident. I’m putting these iterations of writing out there in public and
refining my skills as I go.

> Not everything I touch will turn into gold and I have to be okay with that.

### Start small

Get your idea written down. In fact, start an “idea book” with things you come
up with. We’ll call this the “first step” towards acting upon the idea.

If your ideas are grandiose, it is best to break that goal into smaller steps.
Treating these large ideas like a goal will help you start to break it down and
test the smaller pieces of the grand picture.

Sean McCabe said recently [during a
podcast](http://seanwes.com/podcast/301-stay-motivated-with-your-goals-throughout-the-whole-year/):

> **… work backwards from the result that you want until you get down to something
> so small that it would be absurd not to take action.**

Along with this idea, Justin Jackson wrote a great snippet on [what starting
small looks
like](https://medium.com/mega-maker/this-is-what-starting-small-looks-like-d729f51c4ed5).

> **Want to write a book?**<br> Start small: write an essay.

> **Want to be a rock star?**<br> Start small: sing in the shower.<br>  <br> …

I was not a confident communicator when it came to presenting my ideas towards
design projects. To become more confident, I had to start taking small steps
towards presenting my work. I started first by uploading my work to twitter and
private design groups I was a part of.

<span class="figcaption_hack">I had good ideas for my first site.</span>

I then started to iterate more in public by posting my work to other places like
[Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/darianrosebrook) and Facebook which led to some pretty
harsh but much needed feedback.

Once I started [writing about my
experiences](https://darianrosebrook.com/archive/articles) as a designer, I
started to realize that my confidence was growing and I was gaining some good
feedback on my direction as a designer overall.

The thing is, your goal has to be broken down so that the first steps are simple
enough to start working towards the big goal.

If you wanted to start a global company selling sugar cubes:

* First start by learning to sell a box of sugar cubes
* After selling a few boxes, learn to sell a case of boxes
* Once selling cases feels easy, start moving pallets of cases
* After selling pallets worth of sugar cubes, start moving semi-trucks full
* When selling semi-truck loads of sugar is comfortable, let’s get freight
carriers full of your sugar and sell it across the globe

I’m working really hard at building my skills as a designer to start building
educational material so I have to allow each iteration to become my new normal.
My articles have started coming out weekly, I started a newsletter on top of the
articles, and I have more ideas on where to go that will get me towards
executing my big idea.

> Allow each iteration to become your new “normal.”

### Let’s give them the secret of our work

When you look at people who are huge in your industry, it can be easy to want
their “secret.” You see them like your overnight successes that “got lucky” or
found his big break. And to be honest, a large portion of people are popping up
all over the place like magic. But you can’t bullshit a track record.

Looking at someone like [Gary Vaynerchuck](https://twitter.com/garyvee), who is
popping up all over the place in media about his company and his ideas on
entrepreneurship, one might think that he just showed up out of the blue. But
what really happened was he has iterated in public over the last 10–15 years.
You can [see where he
started](http://tv.winelibrary.com/2006/02/21/episode-1-verite/) with his videos
back in 2006, and [where he is at
now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h346DR1kf0c) with his current YouTube
channel.

Building a backlog where it shows improvement over time re-humanizes you. It’s
the opposite effect of the pop stars that seems de-humanized because you see
where they are now with no idea where they came from. By iterating in public,
you can see where someone’s first ideas were at and how they started to improve
over time. You can relate more easily to the people and they have more merit on
the things they start to teach about.

### A/B testing

After a while of actually building upon your ideas, and executing the ideas you
have. [Moving into A/B
testing](https://booking.design/a-b-testing-concept-execution-b37bf4d744d) can
start to hone in on how your ideas are resonating with people.

A/B testing is splitting the experience you might give someone when reading,
signing up for something, using a product… You give some people option A, and
some people option B and see which one resonates the best with people. It cuts
down a lot of the latency between finding something that works. But to get here,
you have to have a steady understanding on getting ideas out to the public.

Every A/B test, regardless of how valid it might be, requires the same amount of
care when handling it’s execution. You want to avoid throwing spaghetti at the
wall to see what sticks. Give people the options you plan on spending some care
in creating.

This may be the fastest way for you to find if you have a diamond in the rough,
or a lump of coal presented on a silver platter.

> Sometimes a poor implementation keeps a good idea from succeeding. Conversely, a
> great idea can succeed in spite of a poor implementation.”

### Best time to start is yesterday

If you are doing any kind of work, the best time for you to start has probably
passed. Don’t worry. The second best time to start is now.

What ideas do you have just lying around that you could do something about this
week?
