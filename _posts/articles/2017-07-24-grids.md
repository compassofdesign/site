# Design Principle: Guides, Gutters, and Grids

## An overview of where to start in perfecting your use of the grid

Yesterday, we [pulled aside a few systems in
design](https://read.compassofdesign.com/systems-in-design-a3f658a21331) and
took a microscopic look into part of the design process. Today, we’ll pull apart
those systems to look at the components inside.

Our autopsy today is on Grid systems and the many parts inside.

Grids are one of the best systems you can use to guide people through content.
To use them, you have to have a good understanding of lines and shapes and their
usage in design (we’ll go over this in depth during the [Designing with
Confidence course](https://compassofdesign.com/course)). They take the content
that you are designing for and helps you arrange things in logical order and
logical divisions.

They are a product of using a few types of components.

* **Guides:** The edge which you choose to align content with
* **Column**: A vertical division of content
* **Row**: A horizontal division of content
* **Margins**: The area surrounding your content
* **Gutters**: The margins between columns
* **Hang-line**: A horizontal guide to align content to hang off of
* **Baseline**: The horizontal guide for an element to sit on top of
* **Rhythm:** Proportion systems that can help define the sizing frequency and
spacing of each of the above elements.

If you went to design school, you may have been exposed to (or overexposed to)
some of these components during typography or a layout and composition class.
However if you have been teaching yourself, you might realize this can be a very
difficult thing to learn.

A good designer knows how to use a grid to guide users through content. An
excellent designer knows when and where you can break the grid to create
something truly unique. A good example of this is Jon Moore’s [Off Center
Alignment](https://medium.com/ux-power-tools/tiny-trends-2-off-center-alignment-7e355a98a05)
post. It’s such a dangerous trend to follow if you don’t have a purpose for it.
Things that work for those with experience and a purpose don’t always work when
you try to imitate it. We’re here to solidify our understanding of grid systems
in design so we can be one step closer to breaking the grid with purpose.

### Margins

Margins are important to all of your designs. They create an invisible frame
around your content and allow visual breathing room. Your content can be just as
claustrophobic as you are, so making sure there’s enough of a space between the
edges of your medium and the content you’re filling it with is crucial.

Margins are usually specific to the type of device or print work you are doing.
Print designers use margins as safe zones and web designers use them to anchor
content properly on screen. To effectively choose what type of margin you are
going to use, you need to know what content you are provided with and where that
content will live. The proper proportions only echo that which medium you are
designing for. Where print is a rigid size you can determine, most of the time
digital designs are for sizes that are fluid and always changing, and so must
your margins for your content. (size using percentages or ems/rems)

Typesetters would love this section because [designing book layouts is something
quite difficult
](https://www.thebookdesigner.com/2013/08/book-layouts-page-margins/)and left to
the detail oriented. Very subjectively, if you are looking for a general amount
of margin that feels good, have between .25" — .5" (print) horizontal margins,
or a 3% — 10% (web) margin on either side and variably a 5% — 15% margin on top
and bottom. (both)

### Columns & Gutters

Columns are a great way to segment content visually. They can group ideas
together, they can break them apart, and they can balance out a document all
using the content on the canvas. A single column works for simple documents and
for delivering one consistent run of information. As the content becomes more
complex, a multi column grid may become necessary to deliver content in a more
flexible format.

Content can stretch multiple columns, creating its own hierarchy to supply main
content and supplementary content. By diving things this way, you help people
understand what content they should be paying attention to. You can also host
different kinds of content divided by columns (like using the left most columns
to hold images, and the right columns to host text.)

Columns can be further segmented by placing small gaps between them called
“gutters.” These gutters are full of whitespace that, again, creates breathing
room for your content. This helps divide your content without the need for
placing a divider between them. (Think newspaper columns)

Web designers use column grids all the time to align content. Some of the more
popular ones for use are the [Bootstrap
grid](http://www.thegridsystem.org/tutorial-bootstrap-4-grid-system/) and [960
Grid](https://960.gs/). New ones pop up all the time trying to be the best, but
knowing how to set up your own columns and margins creates this effect just the
same. My favorite one for adobe programs is [Guide-Guide
](https://guideguide.me/)to help set up grids using guides in Photoshop and
Illustrator

I am a big fan of using 12 column grids with a 2% gutter width. This allows for
a breathable grid to align content to. I might actually use this with print too.
12 is such a nice number because it splits nicely into 2, 3, 4, and 6 sections
allowing more flexibility with layout.

### Hanglines and Baselines

Hang lines and baselines are horizontal guides that give you an edge to align
content to. They help create what is called a Modular Grid, where the content
can be segmented into sections, “cards”, floating content, and more. These
horizontal lines create a common anchor for content to help drive importance of
main content and segment supplemental information. (like header and footer
content)

Modular grids work best when there are equal horizontal and vertical divisions
(like a square) to seat content inside of. We do this to keep the visual lines
even. Sometimes content that sits outside of these lines creates a visual “Speed
bump” that people can run into when trying to scan the content.

### Baseline Grids

When you create a consistent set of horizontal baselines, you create a baseline
grid. These are particularly useful when designing print compositions, but they
can be equally useful when [designing baseline grids for digital content
](https://youtu.be/5BbVixE0BSA?list=PLeWHfyz6lrQU135WzezvGKM5glxBVRwNJ&t=85)too.

Where modular grids align with the columns, a baseline grid will dictate the
visual rhythm of the document.<br> [Invision is one of my favorite
sites](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Kp66bBZoy8) to get small design snacks
like this (wonder if that term is trademarked)…

Anyways, the trick with setting a common baseline grid is using your base type
for your text as a template for creating the baseline. Much like leading, you
want the whole baseline grid margins to have between 1x — 2.5x the size of the
base text. My favorite number to use is the Golden ratio, which equates to 1.618
times the base size. (It may be completely subjective to use, but we’ll go over
that next week.)

### Rhythm

Now that you have almost all the tools you need to create a grid, let’s talk
about rhythm for a moment. Like all creative outlets, design needs to have
rhythm to help satisfy the nagging feeling you get when things are unfinished or
poorly designed. Rhythm is the patterned repetition of elements in space, a beat
to set your visual spacing to.

Either consciously or unconsciously you set expectations for people who consume
your design for when and where elements are going to appear. You create the
column sizing to create a rhythm across the page and you create hanglines,
baselines, or modules to create vertical rhythm that goes down the page.

As a dancer, there’s a set amount of space that they have to take up, they move
to a consistent beat, they move through visual space.<br> As a writer, you place
particular sounds to punctuate a part of a pattern to pique a person’s
interest.<br> As a designer, it’s creating patterns and repeating elements to
create a complete look to your design.

Your design will be judged as the entire thing, so if you’re great at aligning
the small things on the inside, you’ll create a rhythm that people can follow
and judge as a good rhythm.Like I had said in the last email, a grid system is a
tool to be used in conjunction with the rest of your skills. It doesn’t
automatically make you a good designer, but when you don’t use a grid, sometimes
you can have tiny little mistakes that could have been avoided with using a
grid.

The more practice you get using a grid system, the more you will be able to
notice where things would stand out more if it broke the grid a little bit.

Go out there, make (and break) stuff. Have fun!
