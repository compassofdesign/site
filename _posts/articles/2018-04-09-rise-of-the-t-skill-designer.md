# Rise of the T skill designer

There seems to be a lot of sensationalism behind the polarizing idea that you
should either be a generalist or a specialist. One side advocates that you have
to be doing things their way, all while another side swears by their methods.
Somewhere in the middle, **there are the designers who seem to be getting by
just fine pulling tactics from both sides**.

While we have been fighting over whether or not to become a specialist or a
generalist, there’s been another designer that’s been taking the cake.

### Generalist versus Specialist: the debate

What we went over in a previous article are the potential pros and cons of going
the extreme of either [becoming a specialist in a field of design or to only
focus on your broad range of
skills](https://read.compassofdesign.com/is-it-better-to-be-a-generalist-or-specialist-5e4a805284b).
Essentially going either horizontal or vertical.

Here is what makes either side so appealing or appalling. But it is true that
**the more you specialize and become a domain expert, the more you become
fulfilled by the work you do**.

### Horizontal designers

#### **Pros:**

* You can take on all types of clients
* Your target market is vast. Anyone requesting design work can work with you
* You can choose to take on whatever project comes to your direction because of
the volume of requests
* You can pivot to any area of Design you want just as long as you have skills to
do it

#### **Cons:**

* Competition for projects is so dense that can be difficult to stand out
* Competition also brings your prices down; you’ll have to bid for work very
aggressively
* Your projects might seem random or not congruent when looking at your portfolio
* A client or employer might find it difficult to know what your strengths are and
what you can bring to the table

### Vertical

#### **Pros:**

* Your work is valuable to a client/employer because you specifically solve
problems and offer specialized solutions.
* Your projects look consistent (or consistently improving)
* You can position yourself as an expert or as a consultant and charge more for
your work
* More things may be referred to you as a result of people who can’t do your job
as effectively

#### **Cons:**

* There’s not a lot of work unrelated to your niche that you can put in your
portfolio
* You may have to turn down or outsource work that’s unrelated to what you do
* It can be the only thing you are known for, making it harder to switch on the
future
* It takes a lot of ongoing education, practice, and time to do one thing
specifically

Though each has their usefulness in specific scenarios, t**hese two options are
at the extreme of either end.**

A pure specialist may realize that finding work is very difficult unless they
become a domain expert for a problem that is easier to identify.

A pure generalist may find that it’s harder to make a living doing their work
because they are replaceable with others who can do the same services just as
well since we never mastered the skill.

Where we have an opportunity to improve our standing from either side is by
realizing that** there are still other skills we currently have that contribute
to the success of your project, and to your design career**.

### We all have specific skills to contribute, outside of our specialty

Your skills as a designer are not singular; you’re not a one-trick pony. As we
learn and research design, we are exposed to other design disciplines or other
skills as we move further along.

These start to influence the ways we design and the ways we approach
problem-solving, execution, and display of the work we do. This fresh
perspective is most of the time a combination of several skills.

Though the skills themselves don’t mean anything special, **the specific
combination of skills that you have used together is what gives us the unique
advantage over both sides**. But only if we can embrace the fact that these are
complimentary and not primary to the work we do.

### Why we talk about empathy as designers

Design has adopted Empathy as a skill for designers, and though it doesn’t sound
like a strong trait, it’s one of the most reliable skills we can have as a
designer.

Empathy builds itself from the ability to understand what another person is or
has been going through to get where they are now.

With design, **knowing and understanding enough of another design discipline (or
other skill) that helps to craft your project the right way to help other areas
and facilitate their end goal**.

### Having a few arrows in the quiver is key to survival

We have a lot more skills than we give ourselves credit for. All of these skills
that we acquire help inform the decisions we make as a designer.

Knowing things like [how to edit your
website](https://medium.com/@darianrosebrook/the-designers-quick-start-guide-for-learning-to-code-a1b30783d098),
[how to choose the right printing
method](https://read.compassofdesign.com/print-design-tips-for-the-digital-age-75461d12912f),
[what parts of UX design inform your UI
designs](https://read.compassofdesign.com/the-secret-heroes-of-ux-design-56014d087dee),
all help you get further and further to your goal as a specialist for X type of
design.

So find what you know already or have picked up along the way to give you a
unique angle on solving problems you face in your field of design.

You’d be surprised how much I’ve been able to do as a brand identity designer
with my knowledge of having done websites and print work.

### Don’t work on everything at once

It’s important to become good at what you do. And you will never get too far
trying to chase every skill at the same time. It’s just too much strain on your
education.

Imagine having a hand on three wild rabbits at the same time.

I tell you to let go, and your goal is to go and grab all three rabbits again.

If you were to chase all three at the same time, you might only ever get one
rabbit.

However, if you focus on catching one rabbit, you then can focus on the next and
the next after that, grabbing them in a much quicker time frame than trying to
gather all three at the same time.

### The growth curve and compound effect

Learning skills like this means that as you learn a new skill, you get to know a
little more about what progress you were looking for and what areas you got hung
up on a certain area. Essentially you’re learning how to learn.

As you continue to hone in on that skill, you then become better at learning
another skill, making the *learning* of that skill take a lot less time. This
repeats until you hit peak efficiency to learning something.

These skills compound the time it takes to learn something new and add it to
your toolbelt.

### To stand out, you have to drive that T downwards, bringing other skills as you
go

I would say that this is an accurate description of where I’m going as a
designer.

I’m carrying a certain skill as my specialty and bringing along other skills
that compliment what I do. The more I work at my craft as a branding designer,
the more skills I need to compliment how I present the work, host the work, talk
to clients about it, etc.

Some of the best designers we know stand out because of this. They do a certain
thing, and they do it exceptionally well. What sets them apart is that they
sneak other skills in along with it.

### Curate what you share

Think of some of the greatest names that you know in design right now.

Give a description of what is the main thing they do (probably best simplified
like logo design, character animation)

Now pull apart exactly what makes their work theirs. (you might notice certain
colors, thickness in strokes, animations, types of clients, a certain effect or
typeface, etc)

Repeat this with other names you came up with.

Names that I came up with for this were people like [Jessica
Hisch](http://jessicahische.is/working)e(lettering), [Aaron
Draplin](http://www.draplin.com/work/) (industrial style logo design), [Austin
Saylor](http://www.austinsaylor.com/)(animated logo design), [Rogie
King](https://dribbble.com/rogie) (goopy alt-tatoo illustrated ui awesomeness),
and [Meg Robichaud](https://dribbble.com/megdraws) (diversity illustration)

**Each one of these people have made an impression because there’s something
that they “do” that they have merged with others skills and experiences that
make that work unique.**

**They are all curating the things that they share.**

They are probably sharing things that they want to be known for. And better yet,
what they are experts at.** Rarely will you see something come across their
portfolio page that is outside of what skill they are currently working on.**

They may also have the skills to build their website from scratch, market and
focus on SEO, and have impeccable writing. But **what they choose to show is the
skill that they are looking to do, that they love, and want to be paid for.**

> By curating what you share, you start to shape what people know you for. And
> that is probably the best way for people to recommend you to others. By having
something that is so “you,” should someone ever say I need X done for my
business, that person says “call my designer friend, [FIRST NAME GOES HERE]
they’re really good at doing [X]”

**As both you and them continue to grow your skills in one area, the rest of
your skills start to grow along side that.**

Hope this is helpful in getting an idea of why you should be focusing on one
skill while not neglecting the other skills you have now or will learn on the
way.
