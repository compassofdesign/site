# Creating the perfect team

What could single-handedly make your company difficult to operate? A poor team.

I was recently talking with a friend of mine, a podcast will be releasing on
this subject soon, about the current state of hiring.

### The current dilemma

If you’re like us, you’ve seen many job boards advertising jobs and you’ve
likely been surprised at the requirements for that job.

Everything is going to be different obviously. Working in retail you need to
have some people skills, customer service skills, and a random range of skills.
Usually anything you need to know in an area like this, you can be taught what
you need to know.

This is pretty common between many common jobs, but it seems to stop there.

If you’re like me in the tech industry and trying to get a job, or have tried,
you’ve probably noticed the outrageous requirements for your “front-end
developer” or “back-end developer” jobs.

So why to be a front-end developer, do you need a degree in physics, to be an
aspiring astronaut, and have 6 unrelated degrees under your belt? Now obviously
I’m wildly over-exaggerating, but doesn’t it feel that way?

I’m pretty slick at writing some good HTML and CSS, I know SCSS quite well and
can make my way around it’s functions. I know a few templating engines like Pug,
and I like to use task runners like Gulp to make basic websites.

As for JavaScript, I know enough to get by and can make my way around DOM
manipulation and creating relatively basic functions. I know a good portion of
the terminology I’d like to think and at one point I thought what I knew was
good enough to get a job.

Well, turns out it doesn’t seem to be that way.

The interviews I’ve had, have jumped right into “how well do you know your
algorithms?” and “what’s your javascript like?” even if I’m applying to a
front-end position to create webpages. Like why does it matter what my JS level
is at? Shouldn’t you be more concerned with how my HTML and CSS are written?

If you’re a developer and you are efficient at HTML and CSS etc etc, you need to
be an expert JavaScript developer in order to get a job.

Jobs aren’t really even worried about how well your code is written or how well
structured your CSS or SCSS files are or anything like that. From the interviews
I’ve been involved with and talking with other people, it seems like it’s
JavaScript or nothing, as if that will make you a beautiful websites.

So why is it this way? Why is it so hostile towards those with a certain
skillset? And what could we do to change it?

Have you ever felt frustrated by this?

It almost hinders new developers and even moves more senior developers to quit
the field. If this isn’t an indication that maybe we’re doing something wrong,
or maybe there’s a disconnect between the job ad and the actual needs of the
company, or just something random.

Whatever the case, I think it’s toxic to the future of tech companies.

Well, let me tell you our thoughts.

### The solution

Let me tell you that I’m fired up about this way of hiring. It may not be new,
but you know what, I don’t care! I haven’t seen it nor have I heard about it.

**Team Hiring**

Look at it this way; watching Office Space gave me this idea. The concept of
team hiring.

If you’re starting a tech company, you probably have your back-end developers
taking care of server-side code and whatever else they do. You probably have a
front-end guy taking care of your UI/UX Designers mockups, bringing those drafts
to life.

It’d be a pretty good team right?

Well this is what I want to do. If I have a competent designer whom can create
awesome looking applications, then we’re set.

Next we hire a solid front-end guy whom can write beautiful code when it comes
to HTML and CSS. He knows the best practices, he knows how to keep it clean, it
knows how to effectively structure his folders.

We then pair him up, to create a team within the team, with an expert JS
developer and they work side-by-side integrating new features into your
application.

Now it doesn’t have to be 1-for-1, it can be 2:1, or 3:1 or 3:4, it doesn’t
matter. The point is you’re separating duties. You take the load and the burden
of the new front-end guy to be your “everything”, to be your “one and only” and
you split the burden.

Along with that team, you have your back-end guys you can hand your code off to
if it needs to be hooked up somewhere server-side.

Not only does this release the pressure on your expert HTML guy and JS guy, it
creates a better functioning team.

Now I know money comes into play with budgets and blah blah, I know, but look at
the concept.

This also takes the pressure of your designer, he doesn’t have to worry about
learning code best practices unless he really wants to and all he has to worry
about is further developing his skills in design.

This concept would in theory create a team that works incredibly well with each
other and everyone understands their roles — there’s a guy for that role, no
need to worry.

If I could land a job where I got paid to do what I do well, and learn how to do
it better among other things without having to know the ins and outs of JS or
this vast amount of frameworks…

But sadly, that’s just not how it is, not yet.

I plan to do something about this. I personally think this is a great concept
and I hope it helps someone out. Maybe all of us can help revolutionize how
teams are created and how companies operate.

All I want is to do right by my teammates at
[KeySpark](http://www.keyspark.io/), and I think doing this will not only bring
in experts in the specializations we want them in, HTML, JS, etc, but will
create a more relaxed environment and that is what I’m gunning for.

If you’re on board or agree or disagree, let me know in the comments. I would
really love to see what the general opinion is like out there.
