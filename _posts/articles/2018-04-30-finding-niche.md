# How to find and access your niche

## A two part series of how to figure out who to market your skills to as a
freelancer or agency.

A few weeks ago, I had the opportunity to meet up with [Juan
Valera](http://coastalco.co/) for the first time. He’s a member of the Compass
of Design community that I run, so this was insanely cool to have the chance to
meet him for the first time in person. He is the 2nd person that I’ve been able
to meet up with now from the group.

Juan is a designer who is running his design agency in the medical startup
space. He started his journey as a designer around the same time I did back in
2016 when both of us began focusing more on freelance work.

It is one thing for someone to tell you their goals, it’s another to be able to
see someone talk about their passion.

I have come to love moments like this, meeting people in person for the first
time.

> **If you’re in our design group and you’re ever around the Seattle area,
> lunch/coffee/beer is on me. (:**

We had a great conversation on how we deliver value through design, possible
ways to showcase value to clients, how to access a niche that he had picked out,
and what our goals are for our design agencies.

Out of that conversation, the topic of finding and accessing a niche stuck out
to me.

I realize that even I have had trouble pulling together a specific target group
for both of my side projects. And at this point, if I’m having trouble finding a
niche market to focus my work around, you probably are too.

#### Let’s talk about how to access your niche

*****

### Identifiable group, Identifiable struggle

In my most recent coaching session with my friend Justin, he was talking about
having me narrow down my market to be able to start gaining traction in the work
that I’m doing.

One of the ways that I have heard Justin describe finding a niche is by
**finding an identifiable group with an identifiable struggle**.

That means that if you have a selected group, but not have an identifiable
struggle, that doesn’t necessarily mean you have a defined niche.

If you have an identifiable struggle, but a very broad audience, it might be
difficult to gain any traction or [be seen as the domain
expert](https://read.compassofdesign.com/rise-of-the-t-skill-designer-2184cc54d140)
of that particular problem.

So in order to start, you have to find who you are marketing your skills to.

### Identifying your group

There was a chart that I saw at one point from Sean McCabe about how we position
our services.

Some of us have inspiring, altruistic goals, which when we are marketing our
services to them, it becomes very difficult to sustain our business.

I know a handful of people who passions are doing projects for non-profits, with
underprivileged cultural businesses, or giving back to students and communities
alike, but struggle to keep their business afloat when trying to provide
services to them.

One of the most challenging things is trying to sustain your business goals by
doing work with them, without the support.

**This is where I was introduced to the chart.**

* You can have a nice-to-have product or service.
* You can have a value-driven product or service

**And**

* You can have a group with money to pay for solutions
* You can have a group with almost no extra money to pay for solutions

**This intersection looks like this:**

<span class="figcaption_hack">*I know, that’s my super intense design skills right there using Microsoft’s
Excel*</span>

What I suggest is that you sp**end time working on selling your product or
service to people who have money, get your business self-sustaining, and then
you can focus on the groups that you feel is your duty to help.**

As Justin has taught me, there are just some people that are easier to reach
than others.

So then, who do you recommend becomes the group you focus on?

In our article for [whether it’s better to be a generalist or
specialist](https://read.compassofdesign.com/is-it-better-to-be-a-generalist-or-specialist-5e4a805284b)
we talked about the cross-section of two of your expertise by going either
horizontal or vertical (slightly different than last month’s t-skill but
related)

> *“I have the option of using my skills and going further in the banking industry
> by recognizing things that I can apply my skills towards an opportunity there,
or I can choose to go horizontal and focus on helping other designers (what I
chose to do).*

> *This cross-section creates two pathways right off the bat to allow you to
> utilize what you know about one industry and apply it to the other industry.*

> *The thing about serving markets though, depending on your goals and willingness
> to have what you do support you, you need to find markets that are easy to reach
and willing to pay for your services.”*

**After coming to your conclusion, you’ve got to ask yourself,**

> *“Are these the people I want to spend the most of my time with”*

I think Justin had asked, “who is it that you would want to spend some time
talking to over coffee?” (or icecream. that sounds really good right now)

You’re going to be spending a lot of time with these people, so if your cross
section isn’t giving you the results of who you want to get to know, then take
some time to put together other cross sections of people who you would love to
sit and learn from over coffee.

### Identifying their struggle

If there’s one thing in common with what we all know as human beings, is that
most of us are working towards a better life than we have now.

Though you hire someone to do a logo design for your business, what you’re
really looking for is an identifiable business niche that you can be proud of.

Though you bought accounting and tracking software, you want a better handle on
your finances each week.

**You didn’t want X [the thing] you wanted to become Y [the result of X]**

[There is a job to be done with the products and services we
hire.](https://jtbd.info/2-what-is-jobs-to-be-done-jtbd-796b82081cca)

The same is true of the products and services that we are trying to sell.

**Take a look at the group that you selected:**

* What are the barriers holding them back from the ideal state they want to be in?
* What is their ideal state?
* What skills do you have that equip you as a person who can help these people
attain this?

The answers to those questions are the reason why you should be selecting a
niche group that you identify with. The more you can zoom in and find what it is
you are best equipped to help them with, the more effective you will be at
gaining them as customers or clients.

When you know exactly what they need and how you can help them, your customer is
going to feel like you can read their mind.

**So where do we go from here once we have found the group?**This is something
we’ll talk about next week. In the meanwhile, here’s what Justin had said to me:

> *You need to choose a specific audience. This has always been true, but it’s
> more important than ever. You can’t just target “freelancers,” or “small
businesses.” You need to pick a group that has strong growth potential (for
example, right now Shopify store owners is a hot niche).*

> *If you understand your audience better than everyone else, you’ll win.*

> *— Justin Jackson*

> Next week, we’re going to be looking at how you can get access to your niche and
> start gaining the clients and customers that you need.
