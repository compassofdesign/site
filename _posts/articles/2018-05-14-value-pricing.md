# Switching to value base pricing

## What I have learned so far about implementing value based pricing.

I’m sure you have gotten the same question that I had when starting out as a
freelance designer.

It’s one that is very innocent on the surface but starts the interaction with a
misaligned value.

> *“How much do you charge to design something like this?”*

See there are very few businesses that actually value design. What they value is
achieving their goals and getting business results, with some widely unaware
what good design (or any effort towards design at all) can do for their
business.

The proper positioning of yourself and your business can allow people like us to
do the best work we’ve ever done, work that is the best solution for the client,
all while getting paid handsomely to do so.

I don’t claim to have this down entirely, as this is the pricing model which I
am switching to for [So
Magnetic](https://el2.convertkit-mail2.com/c/preview/pxtehq/aHR0cHM6Ly9zb21hZ25ldGljLmNvbQ==),
my brand identity design business. And by all means, **if you are actively
practicing Value-Based design, I would love to spend some time talking about it
with you**;* especially if there is more to add to this conversation here
today.*

As work inquiries come in, and I’m able to practice what I have learned so far,
I’m starting to narrow down exactly how to **leverage focusing your client on
the expected return on investment vs. the cost expense of projects.**

### So what is value pricing?

Value pricing is something that I believe is the fairest way to receive
compensation for the services you provide for your clients.

When I mentioned pricing models on the newsletter a week ago, I glossed over how
people choose to structure their billing. These categories can be very
over-generalized into three categories.

**1 — Those who charge based on hours worked**

This is an “easy” calculation for most people, especially for those who have
done employed work for most of their life.

These are designers, developers, and marketers who keep track of how long
they’ve worked on the project.

Client work that is based on hourly pricing has it’s ups and downs.

You know what your rate is. **The more you work, the more you make.** You have
the power to continue to incrementally increase your rate as you get better.

The downside? Your hourly rate doesn’t grow as you do. You’ll find that you hit
a market-level income ceiling several times. **Everyone competes on their hourly
rate.** The client wants you to finish work as soon as possible. Every hour you
take to finish the work is seen as an expense by the client.

**2 — Those who charge flat fees on their projects**

Charging a flat fee gives a better view of what it will “cost” to work with the
creative.

Their flat fees are usually consistently priced and includes services that the
designer knows the right time-frames for. This level of predictability gives a
designer a good idea on what they will make if they keep their calendars full.

**These designers are also incentivized to do work as quickly as possible to
maximize profit**. They are based a lot on the cost of materials, estimated
hours worked, and a threshold or base-cost of doing their business. The profit
here is in the margin of price minus cost and how quickly this work can be
completed.

**Clients rarely keep things within scope**. Unless you are really good at being
a consultant and eliminate any changes in scope, clients are incentivized by
keeping things at the budget line. If something busts the budget, which they
often can, clients don’t want to be charged extra to get their project finished.

These prices are often arbitrary and can break the model if clients start asking
what they are paying for, the client extends the scope of the work, any hiccups
in the development stage of the projects, and can often really stress your
profit margins.

**3 — Those who are paid on a commission of value generated**

**These designers focus on delivering the client the most value possible**.
**The more that you can help the client **gain in profit, in gaining better
metrics, in avoiding risk, eliminating costs, whatever their goals are, **the
better you are paid.**

Clients are then also incentivized hire the right creative team that is the best
investment in their business. They also are incentivized to consult designer on
their goals in order to set the right game plan to help them achieve their
goals.

These models of business are all for similar work but are focused on different
goals.

**Hourly goals:**

* **Client **— Finish the work quickly to minimize expense
* **Designer **— Either to max out your schedule and always be working or take
time for quality on each project

**Flat-Fee goals:**

* **Client **— Spend time getting the most work for the best priced services
* **Designer **— Finish work quickly and within scope to maximize profits

**Value-Based goals:**

* **Client **— Investing in the right team that will help them reach their
business goals, minimize risk, and deliver the most value
* **Designer **— Deliver the most value to the client through focusing on
achieving their goals and delivering the right solution

There is an abundance of work being done within the first two business models.
It is the traditional business way for them to go to someone, pay them to do the
job, and get a widget they can use for their business in the end.

For value pricing to have its weight in the ring, **you have to be able to (and
willing to) partner in your client’s success**. Meaning that it has also to be a
change of mindset for both you and your client on how things are done.

I’ve gathered the resources I’ve used which are available at the end to help you
move forward in learning more about this, but let me cover what I know.

### The nuts and bolts of Value-Based Pricing

**Some notes about what I’ve learned**

* You’re not going to get the value conversations down without actually practicing
these conversations out loud with other people. Preferably with real-life
clients.
* You need to be exposed to the types of conversations that people are having
about business using business terms.
* You need exposure to what metrics and values are being measured, and how that
impacts their business if they aren’t met.
* You need to have the client uncover what this work is worth to them, not you
telling them what it’s worth.
* You need a client that is open to talking about their goals outside of the
design and working to achieve a better business as a result.
* You need to be speaking to the decision makers of the business, whether that’s
the owners, shareholders, boardroom, and executives.

The best test of how well you understand value is to test value-based pricing
out in the real world.

If you’ve been following my writing a while, you know that creating value is a
big topic for a lot of the Compass of Design Publication.

If you go through any of the resources that I’ve posted below, you’ll start to
see exactly where these things are starting to click in my head, allowing me to
effectively talk about these things with my future clients.

So in order for value pricing to work, you need to reach three milestones with
your clients.

#### 1. Paint the ideal future state

Early in 2016 when I had barely gotten started as a designer, I met my friend
Justin Jackson, who was focused on “building 100 things in a year” through his
MegaMaker brand.

Th was a crazy enough goal (having to average one full-fledged thing delivered
every 3.5 days) that I was interested in following to see what played out.

From there, I’ve gotten to talk to Justin a lot over the last two years and have
even hired him for coaching in my business.

I swear that we all teach topics that we ourselves are trying to understand
better because I know Justin has this part pretty figured out on *delivering
things that help his clients achieve where they want to be.*

You see, your customers have a reason for wanting to achieve the things that
they do. Everyone does. They don’t come to you because they want a sexy new
website design. They don’t really come over because they want to have cool new
logos, menus, and better-looking point of sale screens.

> The client has a valid reason they are coming to you, and you specifically.

**Try to pick this apart.**

> *A client wants what your service helps them get in the future and what it means
> to them and their business.*

This point is mainly focused on what goals they have, where they want to be, and
how important or prioritized are these goals.

#### 2. Get the metrics that we are using to reach that state

> *e.g., “How will we know when we get there?”*

I always love answering these sections with lists. Here’s a list of questions
that help you think about what we’re measuring.

These are questions that I’ve asked which help me get an idea of just how
crucial what I’m doing for the clients are.

* Who are the stakeholders that are driving this project?
* What are we measuring?
* What does the success of the project look like here?
* How many other teams are working here after the success of this project?
* What key driving metrics can we use to measure the effectiveness of this
project?
* What does it look like if the project were to fail?
* Who or what is at stake should this project not perform as expected?
* What is (or have they figured out) the projected growth in new business?
* What is the current cost per customer acquisition?
* Are there other areas of the business that are working on the same or similar
goals?
* How long will this project remain in effect after completion?
* How does changing things with this project affect the other parts of your
business?

Each one of these questions are just examples of what you could and probably
should ask in the strategy session before doing deliverables.

This is something that you can find more about in the resources below for sure.

#### 3. Assign Monetary Value

**It is very imperative that you let the client put the numbers on it**

If you guide the numbers at all at this stage, you then rob the client of
determining just how valuable this project is to them.

Sean McCabe’s course that he made for **seanwes** on [pricing clients on value
](https://seanwes.com/vbp/learn-to-price-on-value/)focuses a lot on this, which
you’ll see echoed throughout the resources below.

The idea here is that you need to learn exactly what value someone gets from the
answers above.

If the client’s goal is to create an automation that brings their total workload
from 40 hours a week to 20 hours a week, that 20 hours saved should have some
sort of value to the client.

Is it worth it to them for the whole value of their salary? Is it worth at least
half? Your client has to uncover this value themselves through your process and
consultation with them.

From Douglas Davis’s book *Creative Strategy and the Business of Design*, he
mentions that values

> *… at their core, are emotional. And emotions activate behavior.Values have
> worth. Values go far beyond usefulness to have emotional meaning. They are
different for every person, so values are personal.*

This fundamentally changes pricing because what we provide, even if it’s the
same exact thing from Client 1 to Client 2, is valued differently by each
person.

What our goal is, is to help the client uncover the value of the design.

**We got to ask them:**

> *“How much is it worth it to you for you to: reach this goal/ hit this metric/
> be able to deliver this work with less effort etc.”*

Whatever they gave you for answers, use that to help you uncover how much this
is worth to the client.

Watch the video in the resources below between Chris Do and Ran Segall about how
they come up with the value in their realtime conversation. Literally everything
I’m trying to explain here is enacted right there.

### Where value pricing breaks down

Many times when you’re working with clients, you know some of the pitfalls of
the discovery conversations. However, with value pricing, you will find yourself
running into all sorts of new obstacles that, if not practiced or prepared
properly, will derail the whole conversation.

* If you’re trying to qualify a client who is not properly fit for the model of
value-based pricing
* If you’re trying to guide the client with values coming from your mouth instead
of theirs
* If you try to skip parts of the discovery process
* If you can’t back up your propositions with confidence
* If you don’t understand the value created for their line of business
* If a client isn’t open to revealing their goals or bringing you in to help
achieve them
* If a client is more interested in the cost than the value created
* If you start to try justifying the price based off of time or arbitrary
valuations
* If you’re overvaluing how much the work will help the business (e.g. you still
haven’t gotten what the goals and expectations are from the client)

There are many more, and as I continue to practice value based pricing, you’ll
see more content come out how to handle these as I get past them.

### What have I been using to learn about value-based pricing?

So if you want to learn what I have learned, there are a few places that have
been helping me change the mindset of pricing my design and positioning where
design sits in other people’s businesses.

#### **From the Compass of Design Publication**

I’ve spent all of last year writing and curating design articles that have led
me to the point where I am at in the time of this writing.

Below is the list of the best links that kind of explain what my thinking is and
why I feel it’s important to value the work we do as designers. (also there’s an
article in here from Juliane Bone, a friend of mine inside of [our community
group](http://compassof.design/).

#### Jobs to be Done. (JTBD)

Jobs to be done is the framework of thinking that helps you determine what a
client’s bigger goal is. Though they come to you to do some work for them, they
don’t really want what that thing, they want to achieve something better and
your work is a tool to help them get it.

#### Mastering the Value Conversation

I was watching [a recent conversation that Chris Do from The Futur was having
with Ran Segall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtrVGkIVbhc) where Ran was
explaining what he wanted to do with his business, and Chris took the
opportunity to treat him as if he were a client of his, having a nearly
disguised, but flawless representation of Value Based Pricing.

These other videos from Chris Do’s **The Futur **have been a good way to reframe
the conversations and mindset on finding clients that value design.

Design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_TYQQIagwc) — The Futur

[Why you shouldn’t take on low paying
work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8aMA-kbldo) — The Futur

If you see that I’m sharing quite a few links from them, it’s because what they
share is quite in line with what I’ve been learning as well. These videos from
them kind of inspire where I’ve searched for answers to value pricing.

Pricing Design, which was written by Dan Mall is definitely worth the heavy cash
that you have to put up for it. It’s $8.

But this gives you a very good introduction to implementing Value Pricing if you
have never thought much into your pricing models.

One of the best books that I’ve read for understanding how design impacts
business is this book by Douglas Davis, [Creative Strategy and the Business of
Design](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1440341559/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=compassofdesi-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=1440341559&linkId=3047cde6fdb0e3e86fe8da818bb34b48).
Though it doesn’t cover pricing, it will cover the things that help you become a
better consultant, and thus, being able to effectively implement value pricing.

One hundred and one business terms and concepts that have helped me be able to
speak the same language that business execs speak. When you start to work with
higher value clients, you need to be able to understand what they talk about
during your meetings. If you want to see a bit inside, you can watch [Chris Do’s
