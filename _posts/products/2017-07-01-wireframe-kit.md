title: Vector Wireframe Essentials
description: One thing that might bottleneck your projects is creating wireframes and user flows with your websites. I've had it happen and plenty others have where you're trying to get a client to visually understand how people are currently or will go through their website. You can outline areas or sections of which content might be best for their site..
