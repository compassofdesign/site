      <p>The Compass of Design is an ever-expanding project by <a href="https://twitter.com/d_evyn">Darian Rosebrook</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/itssomagnetic">So Magnetic</a>. Together, they fuel the project with the hopes of helping those who struggle with getting started in design. It can be difficult to figure out where to go, and for anyone whoâ€™s lost we want to help be that compass.</p>
