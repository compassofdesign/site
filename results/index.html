      <h2>The grading scale</h2>
      <p>Your skills as a designer will continue to grow as you continue to feed them with education and practice. It is not expected for you to show up knowing everything, and even then, designers who know everything can be really difficult to collaborate with. Knowing your competence level is the perfect way for you to be able to work objectively.</p>
      <p>The scale is built off of the Conscious Competence ladder. Based on the ladder, there are 4 levels of expertise as you are learning a new skill.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="highlight">Beginner: </span> You don't know the skill exists and are happy going about your life.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Competent: </span> You are now aware this skill, but you are unable to use it.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Proficient: </span> This is a skill you can now use, but with a lot of effort.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Skilled: </span> You are able to use this skill without even having to try.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Your results:</h3>
      <h4>Section 1: <span class="highlight">Designer History</span></h4>
      <h5 id="section-1-score"></h5>
      <p>Your level here reflects how you do with seeking out and finding information about design. The longer you are practicing your design skills, the more you will be exposed to a lot of difficult challenges. The resources exist to be able to get past them, but it relies on your ability to seek out new information and other people in your industry. </p>
      <p id="action1" ></p>

      <h4>Section 2: <span class="highlight">Design Principles</span></h4>
      <h5 id="section-2-score"></h5>
      <p>These are the design principles, the things that are almost non-negotiable to have good design. Can good design exist without it? It's rare. Sometimes it happens by accident. </p>
      <p>Your level here is to show how confident you are at using these skills</p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="highlight">Sketching out Ideas</span></li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Using Line and Shape</span></li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Using Space to your Advantage</span></li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Grids and Layouts</span></li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Contrast and Visual Hierarchy</span></li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Typography</span></li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Color Theory</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p id="action2"></p>

      <h4>Section 3: <span class="highlight">Problem Solving</span></h4>
      <h5 id="section-3-score"></h5>
      <p>These skills start to get harder the more you get outside of theory and more into practice. You have to have the skills outside of moving design assets around. These skills here are exactly the kind that keeps your skills from moving forward if you don't have them down already.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="highlight">Deconstructing or constructing a design brief</span></li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Basic Copywriting and writing Case Studies</span></li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Recognising constraints in your design process or brief</span></li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Understanding imposter syndrome and how to counteract it</span></li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Working with developers and project managers</span></li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Designing within a timeline</span></li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Breaking Design Theory Rules</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p id="action3"></p>

      <h4>Section 4: <span class="highlight">Marketing Your Skills</span></h4>
      <h5 id="section-4-score"></h5>
      <p>Marketing yourself as a designer is one of the most important things you can learn how in order to find work, gain followers, sell your designs successfully, and bring value to the design community. It helps potential clients and employers know exactly how it'll be to work with you.</p>
