      <p>Your skills as a designer will continue to grow as you continue to feed them with education and practice. It is not expected for you to show up knowing everything, and even then, designers who know everything can be really difficult to collaborate with. Knowing your competence level is the perfect way for you to be able to work objectively.</p>
      <p>Though your level might not be what you expected or feel like you would like to stay at, know that you can continue to grow if you put in the work.</p>

      <p>That was an interesting insight to some things designers need to know. It isn't that easy to find every resource that will effectively teach these topics. Usually that ends up using all your time scouring <a href="https://medium.com/compassofdesign" target="_blank">Medium</a> or <a href="https://designernews.co" target="_blank">Designer News</a>. That is why we are making the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/course">Design with Confidence</a>.</p>
      <h4>We're building a community for the champions, the pioneers, the self start designers like you.</h4>
      <p>We all have those feelings of doubt. Burdened with the idea that what we know may not be good enough. The imposter syndrome is something that many of us have to face, but we don't have to do it alone. </p>
      <p>Join the community of self start designers who want to level up in their career and seek out things like design reviews, resources, and jobs.</p>
      <h3>Enrollment won't always be free.</h3>
      <h4>Enrollment closes when the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/course" target="_blank">Design with Confidence</a> course opens in July, so make sure to join while you can.</h4>
