      <h2>The grading scale</h2>
      <p>Your skills as a designer will continue to grow as you continue to feed them with education and practice. It is not expected for you to show up knowing everything, and even then, designers who know everything can be really difficult to collaborate with. Knowing your competence level is the perfect way for you to be able to work objectively.</p>
      <p>Though your level might not be what you expected or feel like you would like to stay at, know that you can continue to grow if you put in the work.</p>

      <h3>Your results:</h3>
      <h4>Section 1: <span class="highlight">Designer History</span></h4>
      <h5 id="section-1-score"></h5>
      <p>Your level here relfects how you do with the seeking out and finding information about design. A higher score means you've probably been designing for a while and have been exposed to a lot of the crazy things out there when working as a designer. A lower score means that you have much to learn and lots of experience to gain. </p>
      <p>Getting around people who are currently working as a designer is what we recommend. Either that is through a job, through business, through meetups or communities; having access to people who do what you do creates more opportunities to gain experience.</p>
      <h4>Section 2: <span class="highlight">Design Principles</span></h4>
      <h5 id="section-2-score"></h5>
      <p>These are the design principles, the things that are almost non-negotiable to have good design. Can good design exist without it? It's rare. Sometimes it happens by accident. </p>
      <p>Your level here is to show how confident you are at using these skills</p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="highlight">Sketching out Ideas</span></li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Using Line and Shape</span></li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Using Space to your Advantage</span></li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Grids and Layouts</span></li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Contrast and Visual Hierarchy</span></li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Typography</span></li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Colour Theory</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Your action plan here is to get your theory down pat. Think about where you learned about these skills and how you can use them in your next design to move it from good to great</p>
      <h4>Section 3: <span class="highlight">Problem Solving</span></h4>
      <h5 id="section-3-score"></h5>
      <p>These skills start to get harder the more you get outside of theory and more into practice. You have to have the skills outside of moving design assets around. These skills here are exactly the kind that keeps your skills from moving forward if you don't have them down already.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="highlight">Deconstructing or constructing a design brief</span></li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Basic Copywriting and writing Case Studies</span></li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Recognising constraints in your design process or brief</span></li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Understanding imposter syndrome and how to counteract it</span></li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Working with developers and project managers</span></li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Designing within a timeline</span></li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Breaking Design Theory Rules</span></li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Section 4: <span class="highlight">Marketing Your Skills</span></h4>
      <h5 id="section-4-score"></h5>
      <p>Marketing yourself as a designer is one of the most important things you can learn how in order to find work, gain followers, sell your designs successfully, and bring value to the design community. It helps potential clients and employers know exactly how it'll be to work with you.</p>
      <p>Get out and start sharing what you do. There are plenty of places to start. Facebook, Tumbler, Instagram, Dribbble, Behance, and Reddit are all places you can evaluate to see if that's a decent place for you to start sharing your work. Pick 5-6 of your best pieces (or create 5-6) more and share the best of all of it.</p>

      <p>That was an interesting insight to some things designers need to know. It isn't that easy to find every resource that will effectively teach these topics. Usually that ends up using all your time scouring <a href="https://medium.com/compassofdesign" target="_blank">Medium</a> or <a href="https://designernews.co" target="_blank">Designer News</a>. That is why we are making the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/course">Design with Confidence</a>.</p>
      <h4>We're building a community for the champions, the pioneers, the self start designers like you.</h4>
      <p>We all have those feelings of doubt. Burdened with the idea that what we know may not be good enough. The imposter syndrome is something that many of us have to face, but we don't have to do it alone. </p>
      <p>Join the community of self start designers who want to level up in their career and seek out things like design reviews, resources, and jobs.</p>
      <h3>Enrollment won't always be free.</h3>
      <h4>Enrollment closes when the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/course" target="_blank">Design with Confidence</a> course opens in July, so make sure to join while you can.</h4>
