      <h2>Details do matter. Learn the small skills that help you go from great to excellent</h2>
      <h3>Get access to other designers like you who value the little things.</h3>
      <p>You identify in that group of people who haven't stopped learning once you were done with school. Your teachers, parents, friends, bosses all may have mocked your decisions to learn how to become a designer. You're not alone.</p>
      <h4>We're building a community for the champions, the pioneers, the self start designers like you.</h4>
      <p>We all deal with the idea that what we know may not be good enough. That fear of being asked to do something either in a particular skill or really short timeline when you're just starting out can seem daunting. We'll help take away that anxiety and start helping you build the skills to defeat those feelings. </p>
