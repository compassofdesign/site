        <h3>What you get out of a community is what you put into it.</h3>
        <p>The community is open 24/7. We have a growing group of people from all around the world sharing work they've done and giving feedback to others. These are like-minded individuals who are focused on becoming better at design themselves, so should you have any questions, we are capable of handling them.</p>
        <p>This group functions like an active chat where you are able to do: Q&amp;A threads; share gifs, code, links, and images; and create message threads to go further into topics.</p><p>We have categories like:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Design-Review:  </strong>As a member of the community, you can seek good feedback on your work while it's in progress. We'll help where we can to take your design to the next level.
</li>
<li><strong>Resources: </strong>Keep updated with all sorts of great resources that you and others find outside of the community for designers.</li>
<li><strong>Work:</strong> Here, you can collaborate with other members, seek new job opportunities, or hire freelancers to help you.</li>
<li><strong>Today I Made: </strong> Share something you've made today, if you were a part of it, be proud! We can join in the fun with likes, comments, etc.</li>

        <h3 class="point-title">Design Feedback</h3>
        <p>As a designer, one of the hardest things to get is feedback that is actually helpful for your design work and portfolio.</p>
        <h4>How is this different than posting to social media or media sites like Dribbble, Behance, or Instagram?</h4>
        <p>You actually get to know these people and they get to know you and your strengths. If you've tried posting to Dribbble or Behance looking for feedback on your work recently, you might notice the same 10 people liking your shot immediately or the random comments coming in saying “looks good! you should check out my new logo.”

        </p><p>This chat is free of bot likes, spam comments, and unhelpful responses. </p>

        <p>When you join, you immediately have access to get the right feedback on what you are doing. The group is built around helping others grow as designers. What you'll find is that not only does seeking feedback help you get better at design, but giving good feedback helps you grow as well.</p>
